- en: For teams that don't want to manage any servers, Rancher provides the ability
    to deploy and manage hosted Kubernetes services such as **Google Kubernetes Engine**
    (**GKE**), **Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes** (**Amazon EKS**),
    or **Azure Kubernetes Service** (**AKS**). This chapter will cover the pros and
    cons of using a hosted cluster versus an RKE cluster. Then, we'll cover the requirements
    and limitations of this type of cluster. At that point, we'll go through the process
    of prepping the cloud provider. Then, we'll go over setting up EKS, GKE, and AKS
    clusters using Rancher. Finally, we'll cover the maintenance tasks needed for
    ongoing cluster management.

    answer is that it''s a Kubernetes cluster created and managed by a cloud provider
    such as Google, Amazon, or Azure but with Rancher managing the configuration of
    the cluster. Rancher uses a cloud provider''s API and their SDK to create the
    cluster the same way you would as an end user through their web console or a command-line
    tool. As of Rancher v2.6, the current list of supported cloud providers is as
    follows:'

- en: Rancher does this by having a set of controllers in the Rancher leader pod.
    Each cloud provider has its controller, and each controller uses a Go library
    for communicating with the cloud provider. Rancher uses a process wherein Rancher
    stores the cluster's configuration as a specification in the cluster object. For
    example, EKS is stored under `Spec.EKSConfig`. For this section, we will go over
    the v1 controllers first and then the new v2 controllers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the original v1 controllers, which are found in Rancher v2.0–2.4, the cluster
    config was stored in this object and was only updated when Rancher or a user changed.
    If you were to create an EKS cluster in Rancher and then make a change in the
    AWS console, that change wouldn't be reflected in Rancher, which would overwrite
    your change during the next update event. This means the source of truth for these
    types of clusters is Rancher, and at the time of writing, these clusters cannot
    be detached from Rancher and managed externally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new v2 controllers are only available for EKS and GKE, added to Rancher
    v2.5.8 and later. The idea of configuration synchronization was added to allow
    changes made outside Rancher to be synced to it. This is done by two operators
    called eks-operator and gke-operator. The operator stores the configuration for
    the cloud provider as `Spec.EKSStatus` and `Spec.GKEStatus`. These objects are
    refreshed every 5 minutes from the cloud provider. The local configuration of
    the cluster is stored as `Spec.EKSConfig` and `Spec.GKEConfig`, which represent
    the desired state of the cluster with most of the fields in the `config section`
    being `NULL`. Rancher keeps these values `NULL` until they are set in Rancher.
    Once the value has been set in Rancher, the operator uses the cloud provider's
    SDK to update the cluster. Once the cloud has been updated, the `Status` specs
    will get updated. If you change the cluster outside Rancher, that change will
    get picked up by it, and if the managed field is different, it will get overwritten.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One question that always comes up is, *what is the difference between building
    a hosted cluster in Rancher and building it outside Rancher and then importing
    it?* The answer to this question depends on the type of cluster. If it's an EKS
    or GKE cluster, you'll import the cluster, and Rancher will detect the cluster
    type. Then, assuming Rancher has the correct permissions, Rancher will *convert*
    this cluster into a hosted cluster. At that point, the cluster can be managed
    in the same manner it would be if Rancher created it. We will be covering more
    about importing clusters into Rancher in the next chapter.

    uses. Note that you can work around this limitation by deploying nginx-ingress

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first recommended task is setting up backups. But because these are hosted
    clusters, we can't take an etcd backup as we would with an RKE1/2 cluster. So,
    we'll need to use a third-party tool such as `kubectl apply` on the backup files.
    We will be covering these tools in an upcoming chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second recommended task is testing and documenting how an upgrade impacts
    your applications. As most cloud providers will do a force drain of a node during
    a scheduled upgrade, you'll want to test how your application handles this kind
    of drain. For example, if you are using a multi-master database such as MariaDB
    Galera Cluster, do your database pods rebuild faster than the worker nodes are
    drained? A typical way to test this is by changing the node image to simulate
    the effects of a Kubernetes upgrade. This is because most providers don't allow
    you to downgrade your clusters. So, being able to repeat this test over and over
    again is not possible.
