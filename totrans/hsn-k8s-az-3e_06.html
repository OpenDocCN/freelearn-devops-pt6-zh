			<p>At this point in the book, you have learned the basics of containers and Kubernetes and set up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. In this section, you will learn how to deploy applications on top of that Kubernetes cluster.</p>
			<p>Throughout this section, you will progressively build and deploy different applications on top of AKS. You will start by deploying a simple application, and later introduce concepts such as scaling, monitoring, and authentication. By the end of the section, you should feel comfortable deploying applications to AKS.</p>
			<p>This section contains the following chapters:</p>

				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 3, Application deployment on AKS</em></li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 4, Building scalable applications</em></li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 5, Handling common failures in AKS</em></li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 6, Securing your application with HTTPS</em></li>
				<li><em class="italics">Chapter 7, Monitoring the AKS cluster and the application</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's start this section by exploring application deployment on AKS in <em class="italics">Chapter 3, Application deployment on AKS</em>.</p>
