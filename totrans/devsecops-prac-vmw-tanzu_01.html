<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Welcome! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">If you have any connection to delivering software at scale in the enterprise, we hope this book will be beneficial to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">In this first chapter, we’ll establish the context in which a product such as VMware Tanzu could emerge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.4">We’ll do this with a walk-through of the evolution of enterprise software over the last 20 years covering the major milestones, inflection points, and problems that surfaced along </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">the way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Then, once we have established the necessary context, we can give a 10,000-foot overview of Tanzu covering the tools, benefits, and features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">And finally, we’ll set you up for success by covering some of the technical prerequisites you should have in place if you want to engage with any of the hands-on content in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">this book.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">The challenges of running a software supply chain</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">VMware Tanzu is a modular software application platform that runs natively on multiple clouds and is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">geared toward important business outcomes such as developer productivity, operator efficiency, and security by default. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">If you are looking for a hands-on detailed treatment of VMware Tanzu, you won’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">be disappointed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">However, before diving into the platform’s components, it may help to understand some history and background. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you participate in the coding, designing, architecting, operating, monitoring, or managing of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.3">However, you may not have considered that you are participating in a </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">supply chain</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">According to Adam Hayes in his Investopedia article, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">The Supply Chain: From Raw Materials to Order Fulfillment</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">, a supply chain “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">refers to the network of organizations, people, activities, information and resources involved in delivering a product or service to </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">a consumer</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">When a piece of software makes the journey from a developer’s workstation to an end user, that’s as much </span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">of a supply chain as when Red Bull and ramen noodles make the trek from raw ingredients to a production facility to a warehouse to the neighborhood </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">grocery store.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Every supply chain has its own set of challenges, and software supply chains are no exception. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Most software written today consists of libraries and frameworks containing millions of lines of open source software developed by people who are essentially anonymous and whose motivations are not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">entirely clear.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Much of that software changes hands many times as it moves from an open source repository to the developer, to source control, to building and packaging, to testing, to staging, and finally, to running in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">Furthermore, the infrastructure on which that software runs is often open source as well, with a worldwide community of hackers working to identify vulnerabilities in the operating systems, network protocol implementations, and utilities that make up the dial tone that your software runs on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">This ecosystem presents an enormous surface area for bad things </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">to happen.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">For further reading on real-world examples of what can go wrong with software supply chains, I’d recommend a quick search of the web for the 2020 SolarWinds incident or the 2021 emergence of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">The authors of this book, in their capacity as Tanzu solution engineers, have seen first-hand the impact software supply chain issues can have across the financial, government, telecom, retail, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">entertainment sectors.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">The emergence of the cloud and containers</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">Happily, the tech industry </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">has begun to coalesce around some key technologies that have come a long way in addressing some of these concerns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">The first is what is known colloquially as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">The Cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Enterprises with a big technology footprint began to realize that managing data centers and infrastructure was not the main focus of their business and could be done more efficiently by third parties for which those tasks were a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">core competency.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Rather than staff their own data centers and manage their own hardware, they could rent expertly managed and maintained technology infrastructure, and they could scale their capacity up and back down based on real-time business needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">This was a game-changer on many levels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">One positive outcome of this shift was a universal raising of the bar with regard to vulnerable and out-of-date software on the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.4">As vulnerabilities emerged, the cloud providers could make the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">right</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> thing to do the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">easiest</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> thing to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Managed databases that handle their own operating system updates and object storage that is publicly inaccessible by default are two examples that come immediately to mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">Another outcome was a dramatic increase in deployment velocity as infrastructure management was taken off </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">developers’ plates.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">As </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">The Cloud</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> became ubiquitous in the world of enterprise software and infrastructure capacity became a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">commodity, this allowed some issues that were previously obscured by infrastructure concerns to take center stage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">Developers could have something running perfectly in their development environment only to have it fall over in production. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">This problem became so common that it earned its own subgenre of programmer humor called </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">It Works on </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">My Machine</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Another of these issues was unused capacity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">It had become so easy to stand up new server infrastructure, that app teams were standing up large (and expensive) fleets only to have them running nearly idle most of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">the time.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Containers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">That brings us to the subject of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">containers</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Many application teams would argue that they needed their </span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">own fleet of servers because they had a unique set of dependencies that needed to be installed on those servers, which conflicted with the libraries and utilities required by other apps that may want to share those servers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">It was the happy confluence of two technical streams that solved this problem, allowing applications with vastly different sets of dependencies to run side by side on the same server without them even being aware of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Container runtimes</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">The first stream was the concept of cgroups and kernel namespaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">These were abstractions that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">were built into the Linux kernel that gave a process some guarantee as to how much memory and processor capacity it would have available to it, as well as the illusion of its own process space, its own networking stack, and its own root filesystem, among </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">other things.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Container packaging and distribution</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">The second was an API by which you could package up an entire Linux root filesystem, complete </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">with its own unique dependencies, store it efficiently, unpack it on an arbitrary server, and run it in isolation from other processes that were running with their own </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">root filesystems.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">When combined, developers found that they could stand up a fleet of servers and run many heterogeneous applications safely on that single fleet, thereby using their cloud infrastructure much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">more efficiently.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">Then, just as the move to the cloud exposed a new set of problems that would lead to the evolution of a container ecosystem, those containers created a new set of problems, which we’ll cover in the next section </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">about Kubernetes.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Kubernetes</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">When containers caught on, they took off in a big way, but they were not the be-all-and-end-all solution </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">developers had hoped for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">A container runtime on a server often required big trade-offs between flexibility and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">Because the container runtime needed to work closely with the Linux kernel, users often required elevated permissions just to run their containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">Furthermore, there were multiple ways to run containers on a server, some of which were tightly coupled to specific cloud providers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.5">Finally, while container runtimes let developers start up their applications, they varied widely in their support for things like persistent storage and networking, which often required manual configuration </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">and customization.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">These were the problems that Joe Beda, Craig McLuckie, and Brendan Burns at Google were trying to solve when they built </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Kubernetes</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Rather than just a means of running containerized applications on a server, Kubernetes evolved into what Google Distinguished Developer Advocate Kelsey Hightower called ”</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">a platform for building platforms</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Kubernetes offered many benefits over running containers directly on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">a server:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">It provided a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">single flexible declarative API for describing the desired state of a running application – </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">9 instances, each using 1 gigabyte of RAM and 500 millicores of CPU spread evenly over 3 availability zones</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">for example</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">It handled running the instances across an elastic fleet of servers complete with all the necessary networking and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">resource management</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">It provided a declarative way to expose cloud-provider-specific implementations of networking and persistent storage to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">container workloads</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">It provided a framework for custom APIs such that any arbitrary object could be managed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">by Kubernetes</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">It shipped with developer-oriented abstractions such as Deployments, Stateful Sets, Config Maps, and Secrets, which handled many common </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">use cases</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Many of us thought that perhaps Kubernetes was the technological advance that would finally solve all of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">our problems, but just as with each previous technology iteration, the solution to a particular set of problems simply exposes a new generation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">of problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">As companies </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">with large teams of developers began to onboard onto Kubernetes, these problems became increasingly pronounced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.2">Here are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">some examples:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Technology sprawl took hold, with each team solving the same </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">problem differently</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">Teams had their own ops tooling and processes making it difficult to scale operations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">across applications</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Enforcing best practices involved synchronous human-bound processes that slowed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">developer velocity</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Each cloud provider’s flavor of Kubernetes was slightly different, making multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">deployments difficult</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Many of the core components of a Kubernetes Deployment – container images, for example – simply took existing problems and allowed developers to deploy vulnerable software much more quickly and widely than before, actually making the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">problem worse</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">Entire teams </span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">had to be spun up just to manage developer tooling and try to enforce some homogeneity across a wide portfolio </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">of applications</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">Running multiple different applications on a single Kubernetes cluster requires significant operator effort </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">and investment</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Alas, Kubernetes was not the panacea we had hoped it would be; rather, it was just another iteration </span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">of technology that moves the industry forward by solving one set of problems but inevitably surfacing a new set of problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">This is where the Tanzu team at VMware comes into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">the picture.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">Outcome-driven approach</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">The Tanzu team at VMware came into existence just as Kubernetes was hitting its stride in the enterprise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">VMware was poised for leadership in the space with the acquisition of Heptio, which brought </span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">deep Kubernetes knowledge and two of the original creators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">It also acquired a well-honed philosophy of software delivery through the acquisition of Pivotal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">The Tanzu team continues to deliver a thoughtful and nuanced Kubernetes-based application platform focused on meaningful business outcomes that were important </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">to customers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">There is no doubt that many mature Tanzu customers were facing some of the problems with Kubernetes mentioned in the last section, but they were also focused on some key outcomes, such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">Maximizing developer velocity, productivity, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">and impact</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Maximizing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">operator efficiency</span></span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">These were the outcomes Tanzu set out to achieve for customers, and in the process, they would take on many of the issues people were running into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">with Kubernetes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">The Tanzu portfolio would take an outcome-driven approach to deliver an opinionated Kubernetes-based </span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">cloud-native application platform that was optimized for operator efficiency, developer productivity, seamless multi-cloud operation, and application security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.2">That is the platform that we’ll cover in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">this book.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Companies with a large development footprint that were looking at or actively using Kubernetes faced </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">two sources of resistance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.2">First, they faced a myriad of problems running Kubernetes at scale across multiple teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.3">These are the problems listed at the end of the Kubernetes section of this chapter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.4">Second, these teams were under pressure to use technology to deliver meaningful outcomes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.5">This meant developers needed to be operating at their full potential with minimum friction, and operators needed to be able to scale across multiple teams with a unified set of tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.6">This is the outcome-driven approach described in the previous section. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.7">VMware Tanzu is a portfolio of tools geared specifically toward addressing both sets of needs for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">software teams.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">If you want to run Tanzu Kubernetes Grid locally, a minimum of 32 gigabytes of RAM is strongly recommended. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">You may find that other tools, such as Tanzu Application Platform or Harbor, run best on a Kubernetes cluster provided by a public cloud provider. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">I highly recommend using the providers’ built-in budgeting tools to make sure that you don’t rack up an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">unexpected bill.</span></span></p>
