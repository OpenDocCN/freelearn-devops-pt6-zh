<p><span>In this chapter, we're going to discuss how to get involved in the softer, social side of the Kubernetes ecosystem. We'll go into detail on how the <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong> (<strong>CNCF</strong>) works, and the various efforts being made to orchestrate open source software at a global level. There's interest in our ecosystem at every level, from the individual contributor all the way up to the Fortune 100 mega-corporation.</span></p>
<p>We'll explore how the CNCF and its predecessors, the Linux and Apache Foundations, guide interest and contributions into the people and software economy. Some of the key areas will manage governance, tracking, and processes that are designed to keep people, process, and technology evolving in a sustainable, reliable model. In this chapter, we'll explore several key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">How is the community around the Kubernetes ecosystem <span>constructed</span>? How is it different from the traditional <strong>Free and Open Source Software</strong> (<strong>FOSS</strong>) or <strong>Open Source Software</strong> (<strong>OSS</strong>) movements?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">How can you get involved with the discussion in order to understand and participate in the evolution of the ecosystem?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">What are the major projects, and how are they categorized?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">How can you chose the right tools for the job, given all of the change?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">How can you get involved with open source software in general?</li>

<p>In order to move quickly through this chapter, you should make sure that you have a GitHub account set up, with SSH key and account details configured correctly. Why is this important, you may ask? Well, to get involved with the CNCF, and the Linux or Apache Foundations, you'll need a way to browse, consume, and contribute to code. Git is the underlying tool and process that's used to participate, so we'll make sure here that our toolset is correctly set up before proceeding to the higher level topics.</p>
<p>You can sign up for GitHub and once you've added the account, you can review the help area in the <span class="packt_screen"><strong>GitHub Guides</strong></span> section of the website at <a href="https://guides.github.com/">https://guides.github.com/</a>. For our purposes in this chapter, you'll need to set up an SSH key in order to start cloning, signing, and committing code.</p>
<p>If you're on Windows, you'll need to use Git Bash, or something similar, to generate a key. You can download Git Bash from <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Install the software first, and then we'll set up your environment. The installation looks as follows:</p>

<p>This will generate a key pair that you can add to your <kbd>ssh-agent</kbd>. You can also use GitHub Desktop if you'd prefer to avoid SSH keys, but we would recommend that you use native CLI tools.</p>
<p>Ensure that the agent is running with the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)</strong><br/><strong>Agent pid 11684</strong></pre>
<p>You can then add your key to the agent as follows:</p>

<p>Once you have your keys, add them to your GitHub account in order to accomplish two important things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forking, pull requests, and contributions</strong>: You'll be able to create <span>private forks and pull requests using your own</span> repositories<span><span>, which allows you to begin contributing to the projects in the container ecosystem. You'll need the SSH key and the aforementioned programs in order to interact with Git, which is the underlying technology that powers this collaboration. There's a similar setup for GitLab and Bitbucket, but GitHub is currently the most popular tool and happens to be where all of the CNCF projects reside.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Digital chain of custody</strong>: You'll be able to sign your commits. In order to participate in many of the cutting-edge Kubernetes ecosystem projects, you'll need to digitally sign your commits such that they're able to be attributed back to you. Many of the technologies that we've touched on in these books are used to power large infrastructure at the world's most advanced companies, and it's important for OSS to establish a strong chain of custody for highly distributed code development. The fingerprint of SSL and your machine is an essential piece of authentication and authorization.</li>

<p>As a refresher, let's remind ourselves about the entire Kubernetes system, so we can understand <span>conceptually</span><span> </span><span>where the ecosystem referred to in this chapter sits:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ed0b7a3c-a89a-4afc-8e5f-8cff9642ce8f.png" style="width:43.67em;height:30.25em;" width="4062" height="2812"/></p>
<p>In this chapter, we're talking about the top, greenest layer in the preceding diagram. This layer is made up of hundreds of companies and products that power the software and frameworks needed to run Kubernetes at scale. You can find the highest level of grouping of this layer in a couple of places:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">The first place to check is the Kubernetes Community GitHub repository:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">You can find the repository at <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community">https://github.com/kubernetes/community</a>, and it's a good starting point for anyone who's interested in joining the code-powered portions of the Kubernetes system. In the preceding diagram, consider the layers nucleus through interface, that is, layers one through four. Here's where we'll find the <strong>Special Interest Groups</strong> (<strong>SIGs</strong>), which will allow us to branch us out into the ecosystem layer where we can explore the supporting technologies that enable Kubernetes to stay focused on its core functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">The second place you can investigate to dig deeper into the ecosystem is the CNCF landscape:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">The landscape is actually broken up into a few useful parts that can help anyone from individual users, all the way up to large enterprises, make decisions on what technology to adopt, what to wait on, and what to leave behind. Here's where we'll really dig into the supporting ecosystem in order to understand what's meant to be in Kubernetes core, and what's meant to be provided by the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kubernetes documentation neatly answers the question, what is Kubernetes with the following quote:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">Kubernetes provides a container-centric management environment. It orchestrates computing, networking, and storage infrastructure on behalf of user workloads. This provides much of the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) with the flexibility of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and enables portability across infrastructure providers.<br/>
<br/>
For more information visit <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/</a>.</div>
<p>So, if that's what Kubernetes is, what isn't it?</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">What Kubernetes isn't</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>The most <span>succinct—and currently, the best—viewpoint on the Kubernetes ecosystem, at a level that's digestible both for individuals running their own small scale clusters and executives looking to understand the massive scope of the Kubernetes ecosystem, is the <strong>Cloud Native Trail Map</strong>, shown here:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/81059af1-bacc-4d7e-90ad-b221bccc1ff1.png" style="width:40.92em;height:47.33em;" width="7653" height="8869"/></p>
<p>The trail map helps us to break down all of the efforts<span> to support Kubernetes</span> currently going on outside of the core container-centric management environment that we alluded to in the preceding section. Outside of networking, storage, and compute, there are a lot of moving pieces that need to work in order for complex, microservice-based, cloud-native applications to run at scale. What else is needed to support the Kubernetes PaaS system?</p>
<p>You should treat each of these layers as a choice; choose one technology (or multiple, to render a proof-of-concept and decision) and see how it works.</p>
<p>For example, let's take containerization: at this point, it's table stakes to run your application as a containerized workload, but it may take your organization time to re-architect your applications, or to learn how to use Dockerfiles and build cloud-native applications.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">There are traditionally <em>6Rs</em> involved in moving your application to the cloud or container orchestration and scheduling platform. </div>
<p><span>Here's a diagram demonstrating the 6Rs referenced in the preceding tip box that you can utilize to update your applications:</span></p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/51ffe59d-d529-4d38-b9e8-12ddbe748229.png" style="width:44.00em;height:20.17em;" width="1689" height="774"/></p>
<p>While this 6Rs formula was intended for<span> considering a move to the cloud, it's also very useful when migrating to containers as well. Keep in mind here that not all of your applications will be well suited to running in containers (<strong>Retain</strong>), while some of them should be deprecated for OSS (<strong>Retire</strong>). A good way to start moving into containerized workloads is to simply drop a large monolithic application, such as a <kbd>Java .war</kbd> file or Python program, directly into the container and let it run as is (</span><strong>Rehost</strong><span>). In order to achieve the maximum benefits of containerization, and to take advantage of the cutting edge features of Kubernetes, you'll most likely need to explore refactoring, re-imagining, and rearchitecting your application (<strong>Refactor</strong>).</span></p>
<p>The next area of focus for anyone running a platform is <strong>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery</strong> (<strong>CICD</strong>). You'll need to manage both infrastructure and application-as-code in order to provide seamless rollouts, updates, and testing. In this new world, infrastructure and application are both first-class citizens when it comes to software.</p>
<p>Observability and analysis are also important in this realm of highly complex software systems that control both infrastructure and application. The CNCF breaks down solutions into sandbox, graduated, and incubation areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong>: OpenMetrics is designed to create a common standard, building from Prometheus, to transmit metrics at scale. OpenMetrics uses standard text formats, as well as protocol buffers in order to serialize structured data in a language and platform-neutral manner.</li>
<li><strong>Incubating</strong>: Here, we see Fluentd, Jaeger, and OpenTracing. Fluentd has been around for some time now, for those folks who've used the <strong>Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana</strong> (<strong>ELK</strong>) stack to collect metrics. It's an open source data aggregator that allows you to unify a set of logs from disparate sources. Jaeger helps operators to monitor and resolve issues in complex, distributed systems by providing tracing that can help unearth problems in modern microservice systems. Similarly to OpenMetrics,<strong> </strong>OpenTracing is an effort to build a standard for distributed tracing in microservices and OSS. As our systems become more deeply interconnected with know-nothing APIs, it is ever more important to introspect the connections of these systems.</li>
<li><strong>Graduated</strong>: Along with Kubernetes, Prometheus remains the only other project currently graduated within the CNCF. Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting system that can use a number of different time series databases to display system status.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Service mesh and discovery<strong> </strong>is the next step along the Cloud Native Trail Map. This tier can be thought of as an additional capability set on top of the base functionality of Kubernetes, which can be seen as a set of the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single Kubernetes API control plane</li>
<li>An authentication and authorization model</li>
<li>A namespaced, predictable, cluster-scoped resource description scheme</li>
<li>A container scheduling and orchestration domain</li>
<li>A pod-to-pod and ingress network routing domain</li>
</ul>
<p>The three products in this portion of the map are CoreDNS, Envoy, and Linkerd. CoreDNS replaces <kbd>kube-dns</kbd> in your cluster, and provides the ability to chain multiple plugins together to create deeper functionality for looking up customer providers. CoreDNS will soon replace <kbd>kube-dns</kbd> as the default DNS provider for Kubernetes. Envoy is a service proxy that is built into the popular Istio product. Istio is a control that uses the Envoy binary as a data plane to provide common capabilities to a homogeneous set of software or services. Envoy provides the foundational capabilities for a service mesh that runs on top of the application that runs on Kubernetes, which provides an additional layer of resilience in the form of circuit breaking, rate limiting, load balancing, service discovery, routing, and application introspection in the form of metrics and logging. Linkerd has nearly all the same functionality as Envoy, as it's also a data plane for the service mesh. </p>
<p>Networking is the next building block that we can add to the Kubernetes ecosystem. The <strong>Container Network Interface</strong> (<strong>CNI</strong>) is one of several interfaces that are currently being developed from within the CNCF ecosystem. Multiple options for Kubernetes cluster networking are being developed in order to cope with the complex feature requirements that applications have these days. Current options include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>Flannel</li>
<li>Weave Net</li>
<li>Cilium</li>
<li>Contiv</li>
<li>SR-IOV</li>
<li>Knitter</li>
</ul>
<p>The Kubernetes team also provides a core set of plugins for the system that manage IP address allocation and interface creation.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Read more about the standard plugins at <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins">https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/</a>.</div>
<p>Reading from the GitHub project homepage, the CNI is described as follows:</p>
<div class="packt_quote">CNI (<em>Container Network Interface</em>), a<span> </span>Cloud Native Computing Foundation<span> </span>project, consists of a specification and libraries for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers, along with a number of supported plugins. CNI concerns itself only with network connectivity of containers and removing allocated resources when the container is deleted. Because of this focus, CNI has a wide range of support and the specification is simple to implement.<br/>
<br/>
For more information on <span>Cloud Native Computing Foundation visit <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">https://www.cncf.io/</a>.</span></div>
<p>There isn't currently a lot of activity in the distributed database portion of the trail map, simply because most of the workloads that currently run on Kubernetes tend to be stateless. There is a project incubating currently, named Vitess, which is attempting to provide a horizontal scaling model for the ever-popular MySQL database system. In order to scale MySQL across the pod-structured infrastructure of Kubernetes, the makers of Vitess are focusing on sharding out MySQL's data store in order to distribute it among the nodes of the cluster. It is similar to other NoSQL systems that, in this fashion, rely on data being replicated and spread out over several nodes. Vitess has been used at scale at YouTube since 2011, and is a promising technology for those looking to venture deeper into stateful workloads on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>For those operators who are pushing the limits of the Kubernetes system, there are several high-performance options for increasing the speed of your system. gRPC is a <strong>Remote Procedure Call</strong> (<strong>RPC</strong>) framework that was developed by Google to help clients and servers communicate transparently. gRPC is available in many languages, including C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, C#, Node.js, and more. gRPC uses ProtoBufs and is based on the simple concept that a service should have methods that can be called from another remote service. By defining these methods and parameters within the code, gRPC allows for large, complex applications to be built in pieces. NATS is a message queue that implements a distributed queue system that provides publish/subscribe and request/reply functionality, allowing the implementation of a highly scalable and secure foundation for <strong>inter-process communication</strong> (<strong>IPC</strong>).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The container runtime<strong> </strong>portion of the trail map is an area where there's been some contention. There are currently two options in the CNCF: <kbd>containerd</kbd> and <kbd>rkt</kbd>. These two technologies do not currently conform to the <strong>Container Runtime Interface</strong> (<strong>CRI</strong>), which is a new standard that attempts to create a shared understanding of what a container runtime should do. There are a few examples outside of the CNCF that currently conform to CRI standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRI-O</li>
<li>Docker CRI shim</li>
<li>Frakti</li>
<li>rkt</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also interesting players, such as Kata Containers, which are compliant with <strong>Open Container Initiative</strong> (<strong>OCI</strong>) standards and seek to offer containers running on lightweight virtual machines using technology from Hyper's runV and Intel's Clear Containers. Here, Kata replaces the traditional runC runtime in order to provide a container with a lightweight VM that contains its own mini-kernel.</p>
<p>The last piece of the trail map puzzle is<span> s</span>oftware distribution,<strong> </strong>which is covered by Notary and the TUF framework. These are tools designed to aid in the secure distribution of software. Notary is a client/server framework that allows people to build trust over discretionary collections of data. In short, publishers can sign data content and then send that to consumers who have access to public key cryptographic systems, which allow them to validate the publisher's identity and the data. </p>
<p>The TUF framework is used by Notary, which is a framework that allows for the secure update of a software system. TUF is used in delivery secure updates <strong>over-the-air</strong> (<strong>OTA</strong>) to automobiles.</p>

<p>The last thing we wanted to share with you is intended to point you in the right direction so you can start to contribute directly to Kubernetes or other related software. Kubernetes has a great contributor guide, and you should consider contributing for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a great way to understand the core concepts and inner workings of Kubernetes. Writing the software of the system will give you, as an operator or developer, a unique understanding of how everything works.</li>
<li>It's a fun way to meet other motivated, smart people. The world is becoming more and more interconnected, and OSS is powering some of the biggest companies in the world. Working directly on this technology will introduce you to engineers at the world's most advanced companies, and may even open to the door to significant career opportunities.</li>
<li>Kubernetes, at its essence, is a community project, and relies on the contributions of its members and users. Getting involved with direct contribution of documentation updates, bug fixes, and feature creation evolves the ecosystem and provides a better experience for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, you learned more about the Kubernetes ecosystem surrounding the Kubernetes system that we've been learning about. You've read about the core pieces of the CNCF, and we've explored the Cloud Native Trail Map to understand all of the supporting technology. We also looked at the SIGs, along with how you can start contributing to Kubernetes itself and why that's important!</p>
