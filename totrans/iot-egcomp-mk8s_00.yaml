- en: The idea for this book was born when one of my customers wanted to implement
    a minimal container orchestration engine for their apps on their resource-constrained
    edge device. Deploying the entirety of Kubernetes was not the solution, but then
    I encountered the realm of minimal Kubernetes distributions, and after much experimentation
    with several providers, I chose MicroK8s to successfully build various edge computing
    use cases and scenarios for them.

- en: '*Canonical’s MicroK8s* Kubernetes distribution is small, lightweight, and fully
    conformant. It’s a minimalistic distribution with a focus on performance and simplicity.
    MicroK8s can be easily deployed in IoT and edge devices due to its small footprint.
    By the end of this book, you will know how to effectively implement the following
    use cases and scenarios for edge computing using MicroK8s:'

    ([https://juju.is/cloud-native-kubernetes-usage-report-2022](https://juju.is/cloud-native-kubernetes-usage-report-2022)),
    48 percent of respondents indicated the biggest barriers to migrating to or using
    Kubernetes and containers are a lack of in-house capabilities and limited staff.

    Engineers**(**SREs**), and application developers who desire to implement efficient
    techniques for deploying their software solutions. It will be also useful for
    technical architects and technology leaders who are looking to adopt cloud-native
    technologies. A basic understanding of container-based application design and
    development, virtual machines, networking, databases, and programming will be
    helpful to get the most out of this book.
