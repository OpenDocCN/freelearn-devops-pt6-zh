- en: In the last few years, countless organizations have taken advantage of the disruptive
    application deployment operating model provided by Kubernetes. With the launch
    of Crossplane, the same benefits are coming to the world of infrastructure provisioning
    and management. The limitations of infrastructure as code, with respect to drift
    management, role-based access control, team collaboration, and weak contracts,
    have made people move toward control plane-based infrastructure automation, but
    setting it up requires a lot of know-how and effort.

- en: This book will cover a detailed journey to building a control plane-based infrastructure
    automation platform with Kubernetes and Crossplane. The cloud-native landscape
    has an overwhelming list of configuration management tools, which can make it
    difficult to analyze and choose the right one. This book will guide cloud-native
    practitioners to select the right tools for Kubernetes configuration management
    that best suit the use case. You’ll learn about configuration management with
    hands-on modules built on popular configuration management tools, such as Helm,
    Kustomize, Argo, and KubeVela. The hands-on examples will be guides that you can
    directly use in your day-to-day work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for cloud architects, platform engineers, infrastructure or application
    operators, and Kubernetes enthusiasts interested in simplifying infrastructure
    and application automation. A basic understanding of Kubernetes and its building
    blocks, such as Pod, Deployment, Service, and namespace, is needed before you
    can get started with this book.

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B17830_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Introducing the New
    Operating Model*, discusses how, for many people, Kubernetes is all about container
    orchestration. But Kubernetes is much more than that. Understanding the deciding
    factors on why Kubernetes disrupted the day 1 and day 2 IT operations is key to
    successful adoption and optimum usage.'

    of Infrastructure Automation*, exposes the limitations of infrastructure as code
    and proposes control plane-based infrastructure automation as the new-age automation
    concept using Crossplane and Kubernetes.'

    with Crossplane*, helps us to understand how to set up a Crossplane cluster, discusses
    its architecture, and explains how to use it as a vanilla flavor for infrastructure
    automation.'

- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B17830_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056), *Composing Infrastructure
    with Crossplane*, helps us to understand composing, a powerful construct of Crossplane
    that can help us to create new infrastructure abstractions. These abstractions
    can be our custom Kubernetes-based cloud APIs with the organization policies,
    compliance requirements, and recipes baked into them.'

    Platform Patterns*, looks at how the success of running an infrastructure platform
    product within an organization requires a few key patterns that we can use with
    Crossplane. This chapter will explore these patterns in detail.'

    Crossplane*, covers two unique aspects that make Crossplane extendable and scalable.
    The first part will deep dive into the Crossplane providers, and the second part
    will cover how Crossplane can work in a multi-tenant ecosystem.'

    with Crossplane*, looks at how infrastructure provisioning and application onboarding
    involve a few cross-cutting concerns, such as setting up the source code repositories,
    the continuous integration workflow, and continuous deployment. This chapter will
    look at ways to approach application, services, and infrastructure automation
    with Crossplane in a unified way.'

    Adoption*, explains that many organizations fail with their technology platform
    projects because they don’t apply the needed product development practices and
    team topology. This chapter aims to help understand the aspects required to build
    and adopt a successful infrastructure platform.'
