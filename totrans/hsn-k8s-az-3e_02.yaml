- en: 'Welcome! By picking up this book, you''ve shown that you are interested in
    two things: Azure and Kubernetes, which are both near and dear to my heart. I''m
    excited that you are joining us on our cloud-native journey. Whether you are new
    to Azure, new to Kubernetes, or new to both, I''m confident that as you explore
    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you will find new ways to transform your applications,
    delight your customers, meet the growing needs of your business, or simply learn
    new skills that will help you achieve your career goals. Regardless of your reasons
    for starting this journey, we are eager to help you along the way and see what
    you can build with Kubernetes and Azure.'

  zh: 欢迎！通过拿起这本书，你已经表明自己对两个事物感兴趣：Azure和Kubernetes，这两个都深深地吸引着我。我很高兴你能与我们一同踏上云原生之旅。不论你是刚接触Azure、Kubernetes，还是两者都不熟悉，我相信，在你探索Azure
    Kubernetes Service (AKS)时，你将发现许多新的方式来转变你的应用程序、取悦客户、满足业务日益增长的需求，或者简单地学习一些新的技能，帮助你实现职业目标。不论你开始这段旅程的理由是什么，我们都迫不及待地想在你前行的路上提供帮助，并期待看到你能在Kubernetes和Azure上构建出什么。
- en: The journey of Kubernetes on Azure itself has been an exciting one. Over the
    last few years, AKS has been the fastest-growing service in the history of Azure.
    We find ourselves at the inflection point of both hyperscale growth in Azure itself,
    as well as hockey stick growth in applications running on Kubernetes. Combine
    the two together, and this has made for an exciting (and busy) few years.

  zh: Kubernetes在Azure上的旅程本身也是一段激动人心的经历。在过去的几年里，AKS成为了Azure历史上增长最快的服务。我们正处于Azure本身超大规模增长的拐点，同时也处于Kubernetes上运行的应用程序的“曲棍球棒”增长期。将这两者结合起来，过去几年充满了激动人心（又繁忙）的时光。
- en: It has been thrilling to see the success that we have been able to deliver for
    our customers and users. But what is it about Azure and Kubernetes that have enabled
    customer success? Though it may seem like magic at times, the truth is that there
    is nothing about either Azure or Kubernetes that is truly magic. The value, success,
    and transformation that our customers are seeing is related to their needs and
    how this technology helps make these goals achievable.

  zh: 能够为我们的客户和用户交付成功，真是令人激动。但究竟是Azure和Kubernetes中的哪些特性促成了客户的成功呢？虽然有时看起来像是魔法，但事实上，Azure和Kubernetes并没有什么真正的魔力。我们的客户所看到的价值、成功和转型与他们的需求以及这些技术如何帮助实现这些目标密切相关。
- en: We've seen over the past decade, and especially in the last year, that the ability
    to be agile and adapting as the world changes is a critical capability for all
    of us. Kubernetes enables this agility by introducing concepts such as containers
    and container images, as well as higher-level concepts such as services and deployments,
    which naturally push us toward architectures that are decoupled *microservices*.
    Although, of course, you can build microservice applications without Kubernetes,
    the natural tendency of the APIs and design patterns is to push you toward these
    architectures. Microservices are the *gravity well* of Kubernetes, so to speak.
    However, it's important to note that microservices are not the only way to run
    applications on Kubernetes. Many of our customers find great benefits in bringing
    their legacy applications to Kubernetes and mixing the management of existing
    applications with the development of new cloud-native implementations.

  zh: 在过去十年，尤其是去年，我们看到，随着世界变化的速度加快，敏捷和适应能力成为我们每个人的关键能力。Kubernetes通过引入诸如容器和容器镜像的概念，以及更高层次的概念，如服务和部署，使得这种敏捷性成为可能，这些自然推动我们朝着解耦的*微服务*架构前进。当然，你可以在没有Kubernetes的情况下构建微服务应用程序，但API和设计模式的自然趋势是将你推向这种架构。可以说，微服务是Kubernetes的*引力井*。然而，值得注意的是，微服务并不是在Kubernetes上运行应用程序的唯一方式。许多客户发现，将他们的传统应用程序迁移到Kubernetes上，并将现有应用程序的管理与新的云原生实现的开发相结合，带来了巨大的好处。
- en: As more and more people have started to conduct more and more of their lives
    online, the criticality of all of the services we have built has radically changed.
    It's no longer acceptable to have *maintenance hours* or *scheduled downtime*.
    We live in a 24x7 world where applications need to available at all times, even
    as we build, change, and rearrange them. Here, too, Kubernetes and Azure provide
    the tools that you need to build reliable applications. Kubernetes has health
    checks that automatically restart your application if it crashes, infrastructure
    for zero-downtime rollouts, and autoscaling technology that enables you to automatically
    grow to sustain a customer's load. On top of these capabilities, Azure provides
    the infrastructure to perform upgrades to Kubernetes itself without affecting
    applications running in the cluster, and autoscaling of the cluster itself to
    provide additional capacity to meet the demands of growing applications and the
    elasticity to right-size your cluster to the most efficient shape possible.

  zh: 随着越来越多的人开始将生活更多地搬到线上，我们所构建的所有服务的关键性发生了剧变。如今，*维护时间*或*计划停机*已经无法接受。我们生活在一个 24x7
    的世界中，应用程序需要随时可用，即使在我们构建、修改和调整它们的时候也是如此。在这方面，Kubernetes 和 Azure 提供了您构建可靠应用所需的工具。Kubernetes
    提供健康检查功能，如果应用程序崩溃，它会自动重启应用程序；提供零停机时间发布的基础设施；以及能够根据客户负载自动扩展的技术。除了这些功能外，Azure 还提供了基础设施，可以在不影响集群中运行的应用程序的情况下对
    Kubernetes 本身进行升级，并对集群本身进行自动扩展，以提供更多的容量来满足不断增长的应用需求，同时具备弹性以将集群调整到最有效的形状。
- en: In addition to these core capabilities, using AKS provides access to broader
    cloud-native ecosystems. There are countless engineers and projects in the **Cloud
    Native Compute Foundation** (**CNCF**) ecosystem that can help you build your
    applications more quickly and reliably. As a leader and a contributor to many
    of these projects, Azure provides integration and supports access to some of the
    best open-source software that the world has to offer, including Helm, Gatekeeper,
    Flux, and more.

  zh: 除了这些核心功能，使用 AKS 还可以访问更广泛的云原生生态系统。在 **Cloud Native Compute Foundation**（**CNCF**）生态系统中，有无数工程师和项目可以帮助您更快、更可靠地构建应用程序。作为这些项目的领导者和贡献者，Azure
    提供了集成支持，并为您提供访问世界上一些最优秀开源软件的途径，包括 Helm、Gatekeeper、Flux 等。
- en: But the truth is that building any application on Kubernetes involves much more
    than just the Kubernetes bits. Microsoft has a unique set of tools that integrate
    with AKS to provide a seamless, end-to-end experience. Starting with GitHub, where
    the world comes togeher to develop and collaborate, through to Visual Studio Code,
    where people build the software itself, and to tools such as Azure Monitor and
    Azure Security Center to keep your applications healthy and secure, it is truly
    the combined capabilities of Azure that makes AKS a fantastic place for your applications
    to thrive. When you combine that with Azure's cloud-leading footprint around the
    world, which delivers more managed Kubernetes deployments in more locations than
    anyone else, you can see that AKS enables businesses to rapidly scale and grow
    to meet their needs from the initial startup phase through to the global enterprise
    level.

  zh: 但事实上，在 Kubernetes 上构建任何应用程序，涉及的远不止 Kubernetes 组件。微软拥有一套独特的工具，与 AKS 集成，提供无缝的端到端体验。从
    GitHub 开始，那里是全球开发者聚集和协作的地方，再到 Visual Studio Code，开发人员在这里构建软件本身，再到 Azure Monitor
    和 Azure Security Center 等工具，用于保持应用程序的健康和安全，正是 Azure 的综合能力使得 AKS 成为一个理想的环境，助力您的应用蓬勃发展。当您将其与
    Azure 在全球范围内的领先云端基础设施相结合，Azure 提供的托管 Kubernetes 部署覆盖了比任何人都更多的地区，您可以看到，AKS 帮助企业从初创阶段到全球企业级的扩展和发展需求。
