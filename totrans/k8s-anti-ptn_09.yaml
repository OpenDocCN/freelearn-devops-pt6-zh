    level with a clear understanding of what Kubernetes anti-patterns are. These are
    essentially misapplied practices or configurations that, despite possibly offering
    immediate relief or seeming to be the easiest route at first, can lead to larger,
    more complex problems in your Kubernetes deployments. They emerge from a variety
    of sources: misconceptions about how Kubernetes operates, misconfigurations due
    to a lack of detailed knowledge, or even well-intentioned practices that don’t
    scale well or align poorly with Kubernetes’ architecture.'
