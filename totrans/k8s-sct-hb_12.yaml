    seen as secure enough for sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or keys, especially
    in production settings. To address this, integrating advanced Secrets management
    tools into Kubernetes is vital. These tools enhance security through encryption
    and offer centralized management of sensitive information. This surpasses the
    native capabilities of Kubernetes Secrets, leading to a more robust and compliant
    security stance. In this chapter, you will learn how to integrate Secrets management
    tools with Kubernetes. The chapter will cover how to configure external secret
    stores in Kubernetes and explore the different types of external secret stores
    that can be used. You will gain an understanding of the security implications
    of using external secret stores and how to use them to store sensitive data using
    different approaches such as init containers, sidecars, CSI drivers, operators,
    and sealed Secrets. The chapter will also cover the best practices for using external
    secret stores and how they can impact the overall security of a Kubernetes cluster.

    within its environment. Among them, *admission controllers* and *mutating webhooks*
    play a pivotal role in enhancing the operational and security aspects of Kubernetes
    clusters. Especially when it comes to Secrets management, these tools can be game-changing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Admission controllers are parts of the Kubernetes control plane that govern
    and enforce how the cluster is used. They intercept requests to the Kubernetes
    API server before the persistence of the object but after the request is authenticated
    and authorized. By doing so, admission controllers have the ability to take specific
    actions, such as rejecting a request or modifying the object before it’s stored.
    There are several built-in admission controllers, but for specific requirements
    such as Secrets management, you might need custom controllers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mutating webhooks come into play when we want the flexibility provided by admission
    controllers but with custom logic. They allow you to run custom code (or a custom
    function) when specific resources are created or modified. This is incredibly
    valuable for Secrets management, as you can programmatically modify Kubernetes
    resources; for example, you can inject secret references into Pods at the time
    of creation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a scenario where you don’t want developers to explicitly define Secrets
    within the manifest. Using a mutating webhook, you can set up a system where developers
    only specify a label or annotation. The webhook then intercepts the Pod creation
    request, identifies the label or annotation, and injects the required secret reference,
    thus abstracting away the direct interaction with Secrets.

    This includes how it will verify who is allowed to access it, known as authentication,
    and the rules for how it communicates, called API specifications. Typically, this
    setup uses either service-based or role-based authentication. Service-based authentication
    checks the identity of the service requesting access, while role-based authentication
    looks at the user’s or service’s role to decide access. A common example is using
    IRSA roles in AWS, where Kubernetes services get special permissions to access
    AWS resources securely.

    additional components or procedures to ensure safe and efficient consumption of

    overlay to handle inter-service communications. Its primary value proposition
    lies in abstracting the complexity of service-to-service interactions, offloading
    developers from having to embed this logic in the application code. When it comes
    to secret distribution, especially in the context of certificates and tokens,
    a service mesh plays a pivotal role. To summarize, a service mesh is a configurable
