  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Comparing continuous improvement in Kubernetes to traditional models reveals
    a shift in mindset and approach toward managing IT infrastructure and applications.
    Traditional models often rely on a more static, linear progression of development
    and deployment. These models typically involve long planning phases, followed
    by implementation and a final review stage. Changes are infrequent and usually
    require a complete cycle to implement new ideas or address issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, continuous improvement in Kubernetes embraces a more dynamic and
    iterative approach. This method is characterized by frequent, incremental changes
    rather than large-scale overhauls. In the Kubernetes context, this means continuously
    updating and refining configurations, deployments, and the cluster itself to respond
    to new requirements or to improve efficiency and reliability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the key differences lies in how feedback is integrated. In traditional
    models, feedback is often gathered at the end of a development cycle, which can
    delay the implementation of essential changes. With continuous improvement, feedback
    is an ongoing process, integrated into every stage of development and deployment.
    This immediate integration of feedback allows for quicker adaptation, enhancing
    the agility of the system and the team managing it.
