- en: The emergence of Kubernetes as a standard platform for distributed computing
    has revolutionized the landscape of enterprise application development. Organizations
    and developers can now easily write and deploy applications with a cloud-native
    approach, scaling those deployments to meet the needs of them and their users.
    However, with that scale comes increasing complexity and a maintenance burden.
    In addition, the nature of distributed workloads exposes applications to increased
    potential points of failure, which can be costly and time-consuming to repair.
    While Kubernetes is a powerful platform on its own, it is not without its own
    challenges.

- en: The Operator Framework has been developed specifically to address these pain
    points by defining a standard process for automating operational tasks in Kubernetes
    clusters. Kubernetes administrators and developers now have a set of APIs, libraries,
    management applications, and command-line tools to rapidly create controllers
    that automatically create and manage their applications (and even core cluster
    components). These controllers, called Operators, react to the naturally fluctuating
    state of a Kubernetes cluster to reconcile any deviation from the desired administrative
    stasis.

- en: This book is an introduction to the Operator Framework for anyone who is interested
    in, but unfamiliar with, Operators and how they benefit Kubernetes users, with
    the goal of providing a practical lesson in designing, building, and using Operators.
    To that end, it is more than just a technical tutorial for writing Operator code
    (though it does walk through writing a sample Operator in Go). It is also a guide
    on intangible design considerations and maintenance workflows, offering a holistic
    approach to Operator use cases and development to guide you toward building and
    maintaining your own Operators.

- en: The target audience for this book is anyone who is considering using the Operator
    Framework for their own development, including engineers, project managers, architects,
    and hobbyist developers. The content in this book assumes some prior knowledge
    of basic Kubernetes concepts (such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments). However,
    there is no requirement for any prior experience with Operators or the Operator
    Framework.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is assumed that you have at least a foundational understanding of basic Kubernetes
    concepts and terms due to the fact that the Operator Framework builds heavily
    on these concepts to serve its purpose. These include topics such as basic application
    deployment and a familiarity with command-line tools such as `kubectl` for interacting
    with Kubernetes clusters. While direct hands-on experience with these topics is
    not necessary, it will be helpful.

- en: In addition, administrator access to a Kubernetes cluster is needed in order
    to complete all of the sample tasks in the book (for example, deploying an Operator
    in [*Chapter 6*](B18147_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor090), *Building and Deploying
    Your Operator*). The chapters that require a Kubernetes cluster offer some options
    for creating disposable clusters and basic setup steps for doing so, but in order
    to focus on the main content, these sections intentionally do not go into thorough
    detail regarding cluster setup. It is strongly recommended to use a disposable
    cluster for all examples in order to avoid accidental damage to sensitive workloads.
