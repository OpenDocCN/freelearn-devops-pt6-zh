			<p>The emergence of Kubernetes as a standard platform for distributed computing has revolutionized the landscape of enterprise application development. Organizations and developers can now easily write and deploy applications with a cloud-native approach, scaling those deployments to meet the needs of them and their users. However, with that scale comes increasing complexity and a maintenance burden. In addition, the nature of distributed workloads exposes applications to increased potential points of failure, which can be costly and time-consuming to repair. While Kubernetes is a powerful platform on its own, it is not without its own challenges.</p>
			<p>The Operator Framework has been developed specifically to address these pain points by defining a standard process for automating operational tasks in Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes administrators and developers now have a set of APIs, libraries, management applications, and command-line tools to rapidly create controllers that automatically create and manage their applications (and even core cluster components). These controllers, called Operators, react to the naturally fluctuating state of a Kubernetes cluster to reconcile any deviation from the desired administrative stasis.</p>
			<p>This book is an introduction to the Operator Framework for anyone who is interested in, but unfamiliar with, Operators and how they benefit Kubernetes users, with the goal of providing a practical lesson in designing, building, and using Operators. To that end, it is more than just a technical tutorial for writing Operator code (though it does walk through writing a sample Operator in Go). It is also a guide on intangible design considerations and maintenance workflows, offering a holistic approach to Operator use cases and development to guide you toward building and maintaining your own Operators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The target audience for this book is anyone who is considering using the Operator Framework for their own development, including engineers, project managers, architects, and hobbyist developers. The content in this book assumes some prior knowledge of basic Kubernetes concepts (such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments). However, there is no requirement for any prior experience with Operators or the Operator Framework.</p>

			<p><a href="B18147_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor126"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Preparing for Ongoing Maintenance of Your Operator</em>, provides considerations for promoting the active maintenance of Operator projects, including how to release new versions and alignment with upstream Kubernetes release standards.</p>
			<p><a href="B18147_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Diving into FAQs and Future Trends</em>, provides a distilled summary of the content from previous chapters, broken down into small FAQ-style sections.</p>
			<p><a href="B18147_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor240"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Case Study for Optional Operators – the Prometheus Operator</em>, provides a demonstration of the Operator Framework concepts in a real-world example of an Operator used to manage applications.</p>
			<p><a href="B18147_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor252"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Case Study for Core Operator – Etcd Operator</em>, provides an additional example of Operator Framework concepts applied to the management of core cluster components.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book </h1>
			<p>It is assumed that you have at least a foundational understanding of basic Kubernetes concepts and terms due to the fact that the Operator Framework builds heavily on these concepts to serve its purpose. These include topics such as basic application deployment and a familiarity with command-line tools such as <strong class="source-inline">kubectl</strong> for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. While direct hands-on experience with these topics is not necessary, it will be helpful.</p>

			<p>In addition, administrator access to a Kubernetes cluster is needed in order to complete all of the sample tasks in the book (for example, deploying an Operator in <a href="B18147_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor090"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building and Deploying Your Operator</em>). The chapters that require a Kubernetes cluster offer some options for creating disposable clusters and basic setup steps for doing so, but in order to focus on the main content, these sections intentionally do not go into thorough detail regarding cluster setup. It is strongly recommended to use a disposable cluster for all examples in order to avoid accidental damage to sensitive workloads.</p>
