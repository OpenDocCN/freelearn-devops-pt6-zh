- en: Containers have allowed a real leap forward since their massive adoption in
    the world of virtualization because they have allowed greater flexibility, especially
    these days, when buzzwords such as **cloud**, **agile**, and **DevOps** are on
    everyone’s lips.

- en: Today, almost no one questions the use of containers—they’re basically everywhere,
    especially after the success of Docker and the rise of Kubernetes as the leading
    platform for container orchestration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Containers have brought tremendous flexibility to organizations, but they have
    remained questionable for a very long time when organizations face the challenge
    of deploying them in production. For years, companies have been using containers
    for proof-of-concept projects, local development, and similar purposes, but the
    idea of using containers for real production workloads was inconceivable for many
    organizations.

    Originally built by Google, today, Kubernetes is the leading container orchestrator
    that provides you with all the features you need in order to deploy containers
    in production at scale. Kubernetes is popular, but it is also complex. This tool
    is so versatile that getting started with it and progressing to advanced usage
    is not an easy task: it is not an easy tool to learn and operate.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an orchestrator, Kubernetes has its own concepts independent of those of
    a container engine. But when both container engines and orchestrators are used
    together, you get a very strong platform ready to deploy your cloud-native applications
    in production. As engineers working with Kubernetes daily, we were convinced,
    like many, that it was a technology to master, and we decided to share our knowledge
    in order to make Kubernetes accessible by covering most of this orchestrator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is entirely dedicated to Kubernetes and is the result of our work.
    It provides a broad view of Kubernetes and covers a lot of aspects of the orchestrator,
    from pure container Pod creation to deploying the orchestrator on the public cloud.
    We didn’t want this book to be a *Getting Started* guide.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for people who intend to use Kubernetes with container runtimes.
    Although Kubernetes supports various container engines through the **Container
    Runtime Interface** (**CRI**) and is not tied to any specific one, the combination
    of Kubernetes with `containerd` remains one of the most common use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is highly technical, with a primary focus on Kubernetes and container
    runtimes from an engineering perspective. It is intended for engineers, whether
    they come from a development or system administration background and is not aimed
    at project managers. It is a Kubernetes bible for people who are going to use
    Kubernetes daily, or for people who wish to discover this tool. You shouldn’t
    be afraid of typing some commands on a terminal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being a total beginner to Kubernetes or having an intermediate level is not
    a problem for following this book. While we cover some container fundamentals
    within the chapters, it’s helpful to have basic technical familiarity with containers.
    This book can also serve as a guide if you are in the process of migrating an
    existing application to Kubernetes.

    this project alive, and when and why you should use it as part of your stack.'

    covers how Kubernetes is built as a distributed software and is technically not
    a single monolith binary but built as a set of microservices interacting with
    each other. We’re going to explain this architecture and how Kubernetes proceeds
    to translate your instructions into running containers in this chapter.'
  prefs: []

    is really difficult to install due to its distributed nature, so as to make the
    learning process easier, it is possible to install Kubernetes clusters by using
    one of its distributions. Kind and minikube are two options we’re going to discover
    in this chapter to have a Kubernetes cluster working on your machine.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Namespaces, Quotas*, *and Limits for Multi-Tenancy in Kubernetes*,
    explains how using namespaces is a key aspect of cluster management and, inevitably,
    you’ll have to deal with namespaces during your journey with Kubernetes. Though
    it’s a simple notion, it is a key one, and you’ll have to master namespaces perfectly
    in order to be successful with Kubernetes. We will also learn how to implement
    multi-tenancy in Kubernetes using Namespaces, Quotas and Limits.'

    how, in Kubernetes, we separate Kubernetes applications from their configurations.
    Both applications and configurations have their own life cycle, thanks to the
    ConfigMap and Secret resources. This chapter will be dedicated to these two objects
    and how to mount data in a ConfigMap or Secret as environment variables or volumes
    mounted on your Pod.'

- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Exposing Your Pods with Services*, teaches you about the notion
    of services in Kubernetes. Each Pod in Kubernetes gets assigned its own IP address
    dynamically. Services are extremely useful if you want to provide a consistent
    one to expose Pods within your cluster to other Pods or to the outside world,
    with a single static DNS name. You’ll learn here that there are three main service
    types, called ClusterIp, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, which are all dedicated to
    a single use case in terms of Pod exposition.'

- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Persistent Storage in Kubernetes*, covers how, by default, Pods
    are not persistent. As they’re just managing raw containers, destroying them will
    result in the loss of your data. The solution to that is the usage of persistent
    storage thanks to the PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim resources. This
    chapter is dedicated to these two objects and the StorageClass object: it will
    teach you that Kubernetes is extremely versatile in terms of storage and that
    your Pods can be interfaced with a lot of different storage technologies.'
