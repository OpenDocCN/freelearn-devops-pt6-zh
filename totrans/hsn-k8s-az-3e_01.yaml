- en: With updated chapters on role-based access control, pod identity, storing secrets,
    and network security in AKS, this third edition begins by introducing you to containers,
    Kubernetes, and **Azure Kubernetes Service** (**AKS**), and guides you through
    deploying an AKS cluster in different ways. You will then delve into the specifics
    of Kubernetes by deploying a sample guestbook application on AKS and installing
    complex Kubernetes apps using Helm. With the help of real-world examples, you'll
    also get to grips with scaling your applications and clusters.

    your applications with HTTPS. You will also learn how to secure your clusters
    and applications in a dedicated section on security. In the final section, you'll
    learn about advanced integrations, which give you the ability to create Azure
    databases and run serverless functions on AKS as well as the ability to integrate
    AKS with a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using
    GitHub Actions.
