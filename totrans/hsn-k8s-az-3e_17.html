		<div id="_idContainer372" class="Content">
			<p>So far in the book, you have run multiple applications on top of <strong class="bold">Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">AKS</strong>). The applications were always self-contained, meaning the full application was able to run in its entirety on top of AKS. There are certain advantages of running a full application on top of AKS. You gain application portability since you can move that application to any other Kubernetes cluster with little friction. You also have full control over the end-to-end application.</p>
			<p>With great control comes great responsibility. There are certain advantages to offloading parts of your application to one of the PaaS services that Azure offers. For example, by offloading your database to a managed PaaS service, you no longer need to take care of updating the database service, backups are automatically performed for you, and a lot of logging and monitoring is done out of the box.</p>
			<p>In the coming chapters, you will learn more about multiple advanced integrations and the advantages that come with them. Having read this section, you should be able to securely access other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database and Azure Functions, and perform <strong class="bold">continuous integration and continuous delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) using GitHub Actions.</p>
			<p>This section contains the following chapters:</p>
			<ul>
