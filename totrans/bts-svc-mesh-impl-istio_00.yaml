- en: Istio is one of the most widely adopted Service Mesh technologies. It is used
    to manage application networking to provide security and operational efficiency
    to microservices. This book explores Istio layer by layer to explain how it is
    used to manage application networking, resiliency, observability, and security.
    Using various hands-on examples, you’ll learn about Istio Service Mesh installation,
    its architecture, and its various components. You will perform a multi-cluster
    installation of Istio along with integrating legacy workloads deployed on virtual
    machines. You’ll learn how to extend the Istio data plane using **WebAssembly**
    (**WASM**), as well as covering Envoy and why it is used as the data plane for
    Istio. You’ll see how OPA Gatekeeper can be used to automate best practices for
    Istio. You’ll learn how to observe and operate Istio using Kiali, Prometheus,
    Grafana, and Jaeger. You’ll also explore other Service Mesh technologies such
    as Linkerd, Consul, Kuma, and Gloo Mesh. The easy-to-follow hands-on examples
    built using lightweight applications throughout the book will help you to focus
    on implementing and deploying Istio to cloud and production environments instead
    of having to deal with complex demo applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Introducing Service Meshes*, covers the fundamentals of cloud
    computing, microservices architecture, and Kubernetes. It then outlines the context
    as to why a Service Mesh is required and what value it delivers. If you don’t
    have hands-on experience in dealing with large-scale deployment architecture using
    Kubernetes, the cloud, and microservices architecture, then this chapter will
    familiarize you with these concepts and give you a good foundation for understanding
    the more complex subjects in the subsequent chapters.'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Getting Started with Istio*, describes why Istio has experienced
    viral popularity among the Service Mesh technologies available. The chapter then
    provides instructions to install and run Istio and walks you through Istio’s architecture
    and its various components. Once installed, you will then enable Istio sidecar
    injection in an example application packaged with the Istio installation. The
    chapter provides a step-by-step look at the pre- and post-enablement of Istio
    in the example application to give you an idea of how Istio works.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Understanding Istio Control and Data Planes*, dives deeper into
    Istio’s control plane and data plane. This chapter will help you understand the
    Istio control plane so you can plan the installation of control planes in a production
    environment. After reading this chapter, you should be able to identify the various
    components of the Istio control plane including istiod, along with the functionality
    they each deliver in the overall working of Istio. The chapter will also familiarize
    you with Envoy, its architecture, and how to use Envoy as a standalone proxy.'

- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Managing Application Traffic*, provides details on how to manage
    application traffic using Istio. The chapter is full of hands-on examples, exploring
    the management of Ingress traffic using the Kubernetes Ingress resource and then
    showing how to do this using Istio Gateway, along with securely exposing Ingress
    over HTTPS. The chapter provides examples of canary releases, traffic mirroring,
    and routing traffic to services outside the mesh. Finally, we’ll see how to manage
    traffic egressing from the mesh.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Managing Application Resiliency*, provides details on how to
    make use of Istio to increase the application resiliency of microservices. The
    chapter discusses various aspects of application resiliency including fault injection,
    timeout and retries, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and outlier
    detection, and how each of these is addressed by Istio.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Securing Microservices Communication*,dives deeper into advanced
    topics on security. The chapter starts with explaining Istio’s security architecture,
    followed by implementing mutual TLS for service communication both with other
    services in the mesh and with downstream clients outside the mesh. The chapter
    will walk you through various hands-on exercises to create custom security policies
    for authentication and authorization.'

    is important, how to collect telemetry information from Istio, the different types
    of metrics available and how to fetch them via APIs, and how to enable distributed
    tracing for applications deployed in the mesh.'

    walks you through how Istio can be used to provide seamless connectivity between
    applications deployed across multiple Kubernetes clusters. The chapter also covers
    multiple installation options for Istio to achieve high availability and continuity
    with the Service Mesh. The chapter covers advanced topics of Istio installation
    and familiarizes you with how to set up Istio in a primary-remote configuration
    on multiple networks, primary-remote configuration on a single network, multi-primary
    configuration on different networks, and multi-primary configuration on a single
    network.'
