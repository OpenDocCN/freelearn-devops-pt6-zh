			<p><st c="5627">In this book, you</st><a id="_idIndexMarker588"/><st c="5645"> only built REST APIs. </st><st c="5668">However, there are other types of APIs that are not RESTful. </st><st c="5729">A very popular example </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5752">is GraphQL.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="5763">GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs, originally developed by Facebook in 2012. </st><st c="5868">It provides an efficient, powerful, and flexible approach to building and consuming APIs and has become increasingly popular for use with cloud applications. </st><st c="6026">The reason it has become so popular is that it solves the problems of overfetching, retrieving more data than needed, and underfetching, requiring multiple requests to fetch related data, which are common problems in traditional </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6255">REST APIs.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6265">There are some important characteristics to have </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6315">in mind:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><st c="6323">Instead of having multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint for querying data. </st><st c="6449">This simplifies the API surface and makes it easier to evolve the API </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6519">over time.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="6529">It uses a strongly typed query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need from the server. </st><st c="6645">This contrasts with traditional REST APIs where the server often returns more data than the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6737">client needs.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="6750">With GraphQL, the client has more control over the data it receives, allowing for better performance and flexibility. </st><st c="6869">It has a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6878">client-driven architecture.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="6905">GraphQL APIs are built around a schema that defines the types, queries, mutations, and relationships between different data entities. </st><st c="7040">This schema acts as a contract between the client and server, ensuring data consistency and enabling </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7141">powerful tooling.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="7158">In AWS, AppSync is a managed service that makes it easy to build scalable GraphQL APIs. </st><st c="7247">AppSync simplifies the process of building GraphQL APIs by handling the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and security aspects, allowing developers to focus on building their application logic; this is the same as what an API gateway does for </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7492">REST APIs.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="8378">Generative AI refers to a class of AI models and techniques capable of generating new data, such as text, images, audio, or other multimedia, based on the training data they have been exposed to. </st><st c="8575">Unlike traditional AI models that primarily focus on analyzing or classifying existing data, generative AI models learn the underlying patterns and characteristics of the training data and use this knowledge to create new, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8798">original content.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="11477">The most prevalent</st><a id="_idIndexMarker597"/><st c="11496"> communication pattern is synchronous request/response. </st><st c="11552">For example, when you visit a web page (request), your browser fetches and renders the result (response). </st><st c="11658">This process occurs synchronously, meaning you wait for the response after making the request. </st><st c="11753">But in modern distributed architectures, you will sometimes encounter the need for different communication patterns, for example, in long processing tasks, where blocking the client while waiting for a response interferes with the customer experience, or when you need to deliver the exact same content to many </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12064">different receivers.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12084">Some popular patterns are asynchronous processing, fan-out and broadcasting, and event-driven. </st><st c="12180">Let’s start by looking at </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12206">asynchronous processing.</st></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><st c="12659">Clients can send requests without waiting for subscribers to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12721">process them.</st></span></li>
				<li><st c="12734">Subscribers can consume messages at their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12777">own pace.</st></span></li>

			<h3><st c="13647">Fan-out and broadcasting</st></h3>
			<p><st c="13672">Fan-out is used when you need to deliver a single message to multiple endpoints of your choice. </st><st c="13769">Broadcasting applies the same concept but sends the message to all endpoints rather than just the selected ones. </st><st c="13882">Imagine you have a phonebook: fan-out is like messaging every single person individually, while broadcasting is like creating a group chat and sending the message to everyone in the group. </st><st c="14071">This approach is common in notification systems, data replication or synchronization tasks, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14167">event-driven architectures.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="14194">In AWS, there is Amazon </st><strong class="bold"><st c="14219">Simple Notification Service</st></strong><st c="14246"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="14248">SNS</st></strong><st c="14251">). </st><st c="14255">It is a fully managed pub/sub messaging</st><a id="_idIndexMarker603"/><st c="14294"> service. </st><st c="14304">Unlike SQS, it allows for a single message to be delivered to multiple consumers. </st><st c="14386">It functions on a push-based mechanism, instead of pull-based </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14448">like SQS.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="14457">Considering the previous asynchronous processing scenario, this time you needed to process the same submitted image twice, and you have two different computing clusters for this. </st><st c="14637">With SQS, messages are only processed once. </st><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="14681">Figure 9</st></em></span><em class="italic"><st c="14689">.6</st></em><st c="14691"> shows how to accomplish this using SNS and SQS in a fan-out configuration. </st><st c="14767">When SNS is triggered, it replicates the received message and delivers it to both SQS queues. </st><st c="14861">Each of the two compute clusters then polls its respective SQS queue and processes </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="14944">the message.</st></span></p>

			<h3><st c="15291">Event-driven</st></h3>
			<p><st c="15304">Event-driven</st><a id="_idIndexMarker606"/><st c="15317"> refers to a programming</st><a id="_idIndexMarker607"/><st c="15341"> paradigm or architectural pattern where the flow of a program is determined by events. </st><st c="15429">In an event-driven system, the program’s execution path is triggered by the occurrence of specific events, rather than following a predefined sequential flow of instructions. </st><st c="15604">Events can be generated by various sources, such as user interactions (e.g., clicks or key presses), system notifications (e.g., file changes or network events), hardware interruptions (e.g., timer or sensor data), or messages from other components </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="15853">or systems.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="15864">All services in AWS generate events. </st><st c="15902">You can take actions based on them using AWS EventBridge (formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). </st><st c="16005">It is a serverless event </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16030">bus service.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="16042">A common example of the use of event-driven architecture is as follows: a client uploads a file to your S3 bucket, which emits an event. </st><st c="16180">Based on this event, you trigger a processing pipeline for the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="16243">uploaded file.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="16257">All these topics are vast but well documented. </st><st c="16305">Familiarize yourself with them. </st><st c="16337">If you would like to learn more about it, we recommend the AWS whitepaper </st><em class="italic"><st c="16411">Implementing Microservices on </st></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="16441">AWS</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="16444">: </st></span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/communication-mechanisms.html"><span class="No-Break"><st c="16447">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/communication-mechanisms.html</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="16544">.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="27931">But if you are searching for something pre-built, tested and vetted by others, and accompanied by an IaC template such as CloudFormation, AWS Solutions Library (</st><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/"><st c="28093">https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/</st></a><st c="28127">) is the place to go. </st><st c="28150">The library also includes AWS </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28180">Partner solutions.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="30012">Unlike Solutions Library, not all are practical, nor accompanied by architecture diagrams </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30103">and code.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="30112">There are three types </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30135">of resources:</st></span></p>

			</ul>
			<p><st c="30598">When you are starting out, patterns are the most useful. </st><st c="30656">They detail popular </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30676">service configurations.</st></span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/><st c="31313">Summary</st></h1>
			<p><st c="31321">In this chapter, you learned about other AWS services that you could have used to build the different sample projects throughout the book. </st><st c="31461">This has shown how architecture is about trade-offs more than it is about building the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31548">perfect solution.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31565">You also learned about AWS Pricing Calculator and how it can help you estimate costs before building your projects. </st><st c="31682">You created pricing estimates for the projects from </st><em class="italic"><st c="31734">Chapters 2</st></em> <span class="No-Break"><st c="31744">and </st></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="31749">6</st></em></span><span class="No-Break"><st c="31750">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31751">Lastly, you explored many of AWS’ learning resources. </st><st c="31806">Some of them may have been new to you, such as AWS re:Posts, while others are part of the now-familiar AWS Architecture Center, the one-stop shop for prescriptive guidance </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31978">and resources.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31992">There are too many AWS services, architectural patterns, and techniques to cover in a single book. </st><st c="32092">But if you know the fundamentals, that should raise the level of everything </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32168">you do.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="32175">Congratulations on finishing this extensive journey, packed with hands-on projects and cloud knowledge. </st><st c="32280">Although this is the end of the book, it is just the beginning of your AWS </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32355">cloud journey.</st></span></p>
