<p>With the trend of microservices architecture in the recent years, a monolithic application is refactored into multiple microservices. Container simplifies the deployment of the application build from microservices. Container management, automation, and orchestration have become crucial problems. Kubernetes is here to solve these.</p>

<div class="column">
<p><span>This book is a practical guide that provides step-by-step tips and examples to help you build and run your own Kubernetes cluster in both private and public clouds. Following along with the book will lead you to understanding how to deploy and manage your application and services in Kubernetes</span><span>. You will also gain a deep understanding of how to scale and update live</span> <span>containers, and how to do port forwarding and network routing in Kubernetes. You will learn how to build a robust high-availability cluster with the book's hands-on examples. Finally, you will build a Continuous Delivery pipeline by integrating Jenkins, Docker registry, and Kubernetes.<br/></span></p>

<p>If you've been playing with Docker containers for a while and want to orchestrate your containers in a modern way, this book is the right choice for you. This book is for those who already understand Docker and container technology, and want to explore further to find better ways to orchestrate, manage, and deploy containers. This book is perfect for going beyond a single container and working with container clusters, learning how to build your own Kubernetes, and making it work seamlessly with your Continuous Delivery pipeline.</p>

<p>Throughout the book, we use at least three servers with a Linux-based OS to build all of the components in Kubernetes. At the beginning of the book, you could use one machine, whether it is Linux or Windows, to learn about the concepts and basic deployment. From a scalability point of view, we recommend you start with three servers in order to scale out the components independently and push your cluster to the production level.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>:<span> </span><span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles.<span> </span><span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Prepare the following YAML file, whic</span>h is a <span>simple Deployment that launches two </span><kbd>nginx</kbd><span> containers.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre># cat 3-1-1_deployment.yaml<br/>apiVersion: apps/v1<br/>kind: Deployment<br/>metadata:<br/>  name: my-nginx</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=1<br/>Selector:               env=test,project=My-Happy-Web,role=frontend<br/>Replicas:               5 desired | 5 updated | 5 total | 5 available | 0 unavailable<br/>StrategyType:           <strong>RollingUpdate</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="CommandLinePACKT"><strong>//install kubectl command by "kubernetes-cli" package</strong><br/><strong>$ brew install kubernetes-cli</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Installation is straightforward, so we can just choose the default options and click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span></span>.<span>"</span></p>
