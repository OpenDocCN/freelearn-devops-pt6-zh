    Service** (**AKS**). The applications were always self-contained, meaning the
    full application was able to run in its entirety on top of AKS. There are certain
    advantages of running a full application on top of AKS. You gain application portability
    since you can move that application to any other Kubernetes cluster with little
    friction. You also have full control over the end-to-end application.

    to offloading parts of your application to one of the PaaS services that Azure
    offers. For example, by offloading your database to a managed PaaS service, you
    no longer need to take care of updating the database service, backups are automatically
    performed for you, and a lot of logging and monitoring is done out of the box.

    and the advantages that come with them. Having read this section, you should be
    able to securely access other Azure services, such as Azure SQL Database and Azure
    Functions, and perform **continuous integration and continuous delivery** (**CI/CD**)
    using GitHub Actions.
