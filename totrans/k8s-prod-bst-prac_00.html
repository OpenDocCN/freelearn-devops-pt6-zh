			<p>Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform originally developed by Google and made available to the public in 2014. The popularity of Kubernetes helped to make the deployment of container-based, complex, distributed systems simpler to manage for developers. Since its inception, the community has built a large ecosystem around Kubernetes, with many open source projects that have made the automation of management functions possible.</p>
			<p>This book is specifically designed to quickly help Kubernetes administrators and <strong class="bold">site reliability engineers</strong> (<strong class="bold">SREs</strong>) to build and manage production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure following industry best practices and well-proven techniques learned from early technology adopters of large-scale Kubernetes deployments.</p>
			<p>While we use Amazon <strong class="bold">Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS</strong>) to deliver the practical exercises in this book, we believe that the explained Kubernetes design, provisioning, and configuration concepts and techniques remain valid for other cloud providers. Regarding the selection of provisioning and configuration tools, we decided to use cloud-agnostic tools such as Terraform and Ansible to ensure portability across cloud providers.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Kubernetes in Production Best Practices</em> gives you the confidence to use Kubernetes to host your production workloads, having the comprehensive infrastructure design knowledge to build your clusters and a clear understanding of managing and operating them efficiently.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is ideal for cloud infrastructure architects, SREs, DevOps engineers, system administrators, and engineering managers who have a basic knowledge of Kubernetes and are willing to apply cloud industry best practices to design, build, and operate production-grade Kubernetes clusters.</p>
			<p>A basic knowledge of Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and Bash will be beneficial.</p>
