    environments through the lens of **GitOps** practices. As cloud-native applications
    grow in complexity and scale, the ability to observe, understand, and react to
    their behavior becomes increasingly critical. This chapter is designed to bridge
    the gap between traditional operational methods and the dynamic, automated world
    of GitOps, offering a pathway to more resilient, responsive, and efficient systems.

    (**SRE**) principles with the GitOps framework. GitOps, a term that has rapidly
    gained traction in the DevOps community, leverages the power of Git as a single
    source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. By applying GitOps,
    we not only automate and streamline deployment processes but also enhance the

    the GitOps paradigm, distinguishing between internal and external observability
    to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. Internal observability
    sheds light on the workings within the system—through **metrics**, **logs**, and
    **traces**—while external observability focuses on the experience outside the
    system, such as user interactions and external dependencies.

    Research and Assessment** (**DORA**) metrics—deployment frequency, lead time for
    changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service—this approach offers
    a robust framework for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of GitOps practices.

    have a web app, such as an online store, which generates application logs such
    as which user has logged in, system logs such as unexpected shutdowns, metrics
    such as the CPU and RAM usage of individual containers, and traces that map the

    part of the core functionality of our application. This includes monitoring external
    services and third-party components such as networking and CPU usage. For example,
    within a Kubernetes cluster, an internal service in the same namespace can be
    directly monitored. Alternatively, in a different namespace, monitoring can be
    done via internal DNS names. This approach does not operate at the system level
    of the nodes but through permitted accesses in the overlay network using a service

    techniques, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,
    organizations can ensure that their systems remain observable, manageable, and
    performant, regardless of scale. This holistic approach not only addresses the
    technical challenges of observability at scale but also aligns observability practices
    with broader business objectives, driving value and competitive advantage in today’s
    dynamic and complex technology landscape.

    and desired outcomes. It’s often not easy, as many use cases sound similar but
    have different requirements. Here are some insights to help you combine different
    tools for the optimal observability stack. The goal is not to find the perfect
    tool but to focus on the different layers of observability. To clarify the understanding
    and different requirements for observability, I’ve added possible stakeholders.
    This list is not exhaustive but includes key stakeholders and their interests
    based on various real projects. I hope these insights will help you get the most
    out of your observability setup.

    teams in observability processes. However, this does not work because, for example,
    security teams in our projects are used to regulating rules independently in the
    company’s interests. To achieve this, they use their own tools, which cause additional
    overheads.'
  prefs:

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    out Falco rules and Prometheus alert configurations, for instance, to detect unwanted
    syscalls such as shell openings on a node, and trigger alerts accordingly. However,
    this often increases the responsibility burden and can result in alerts not being
    thoroughly investigated.

    time and costs, providing our stakeholders with the necessary autonomy, and boosting
    overall motivation. By creating an environment where teams can manage their observability
    configurations without the constant back-and-forth of tickets, we foster independence
    and a healthy error culture. Teams understand that if something goes wrong, a
    simple commit revert will restore the previous state, making the process more
    resilient and reliable. This approach transforms collaboration across different
    departments, ensuring that observability is seamlessly integrated into our development
    and operational workflows.

    tackle new challenges. This collaborative approach not only enhances team efficiency
    but also promotes a culture of continuous improvement and shared responsibility.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This comprehensive chapter traversed the intricate landscape of observability
    within cloud-native applications, emphasizing its critical role across various
    dimensions of GitOps and Kubernetes environments. Starting with the foundational
    principles of SRE, we explored how these practices are seamlessly integrated into
    GitOps workflows, enhancing the reliability and performance of Kubernetes deployments.
    The distinction between internal and external observability was clarified, underscoring
    the importance of a balanced approach for comprehensive system insight. We further
    delved into the strategic implementation of SLO-driven performance metrics aligned
    with DORA indicators, offering a structured framework for continuous improvement.
    Through the lens of Linkerd, we examined the deployment of distributed tracing
    within GitOps, highlighting the enhanced visibility and diagnostic capabilities
    it brings to microservices architectures. Monitoring and alerting strategies,
    empowered by tools such as OpenTelemetry, were discussed to establish proactive
    incident management and system health monitoring. Finally, scaling observability
    to meet the demands of growing and complex systems was addressed, showcasing the
    necessity of advanced tooling, organizational strategies, and a culture that prioritizes
    observability. This chapter encapsulated a holistic view of implementing and scaling
    observability in modern cloud-native ecosystems, ensuring that systems are not
    only observable but also resilient and efficient.
