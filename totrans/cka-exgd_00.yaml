- en: Kubernetes is by far the most popular container orchestration tool, yet the
    complexities of managing the tool have led to the rise of fully managed Kubernetes
    services over the past few years. The **Certified Kubernetes Administrator** (**CKA**)
    certification is designed to ensure that certification candidates have the skills
    and knowledge to help them establish their credibility and value in the job market,
    to support business growth.

    the core concept of Kubernetes, and then we will take a deep dive into main Kubernetes
    primitives with hands-on scenarios for installation and configuration, cluster
    management and workload scheduling, networking, and security. Furthermore, we’ll
    discuss how to troubleshoot Kubernetes in our daily practice.
