- en: Kubernetes Secrets management is a combination of practices and tools that help
    users to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens,
    and certificates, within a Kubernetes cluster and keep them safe and secure. Securing
    Secrets such as passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information is critical
    for protecting applications and data from unauthorized access. Developers who
    understand Kubernetes Secrets management can help ensure that Secrets are managed
    securely and effectively, reducing the risk of security breaches. Many industries
    and regulatory frameworks have specific requirements for managing sensitive data.
    By learning Kubernetes Secrets management practices, developers can ensure that
    their applications comply with these requirements and avoid potential legal or
    financial penalties.
