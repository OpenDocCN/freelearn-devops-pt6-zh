            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The last two main pieces of the Master nodes are <kbd>kube-controller-manager</kbd> and <kbd>cloud-controller-manager</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>"conditions": [<br/>  {<br/>    "type": "Ready",<br/>    "status": "True"<br/>  }</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>"conditions": [<br/>  {<br/>   <strong> "type": "Ready"</strong>,<br/>    "status": "True"<br/>  }</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ kubectl describe pods/node-js-pod</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click on <span class="packt_screen">Jobs</span> and then <span class="packt_screen">long-task</span> from the list, so we can see the details.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
