			<p>We are nearing the end of our journey in <em class="italic">Observability with Grafana</em>, so this is a good time to revisit some of the things we have learned. In this chapter, we will review the best practices for data collection and look at troubleshooting techniques that can help get your telemetry into Grafana. We will then move on to the Grafana stack for more best practices and troubleshooting with your telemetry backend, alerts, and dashboards. We will identify some of the pitfalls of observability and how to avoid them. Then, before wrapping up, we will look to the future and explore potential trends on <span class="No-Break">the horizon.</span></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Best practices and troubleshooting for <span class="No-Break">data collection</span></li>
				<li>Best practices and troubleshooting for the <span class="No-Break">Grafana stack</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Best practices and troubleshooting for data collection</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, we have repeatedly talked about the importance of preparation, setting objectives, and defining requirements. Doing the upfront thought work cannot be underestimated, but sadly, it is often completely overlooked. There are far too many occasions where I have investigated a company’s observability platform and discovered collection agents have been deployed without thought, opening the floodgates to send everything into the backend. The price is an excess of undefined telemetry, making it hard to do your job and causing expensive operating and <span class="No-Break">storage costs.</span></p>
			<p>In this section, we’ll be sharing some best practices for data collection, together with some useful troubleshooting tips. Let’s first look at preparation activities for <span class="No-Break">data collection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Preparing for data collection</h2>
			<p>Observability starts with a need or desire<a id="_idIndexMarker1195"/> to monitor and observe systems, and to do that, we need data. However, too much data (and data for the sake of data) can break your system’s observability, which is why it is important to prepare. Set your objectives, considering what you want from your platform and who it is for. Instead of planning for the <em class="italic">what if</em>, plan for <em class="italic">what is</em>. You can always add to it later, which is much easier than taking away after <span class="No-Break">the fact.</span></p>
			<p>In <a href="B18277_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, we introduced observability personas. You can use these to gather platform requirements. Ideally, you want to be able to answer the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who are my <span class="No-Break">observability customers?</span></li>
				<li>What log formats do I want or have in <span class="No-Break">my system?</span></li>
				<li>What is the origin of <span class="No-Break">the data?</span></li>
				<li>What metrics<a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/> are important for our <strong class="bold">service-level </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">objectives</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SLOs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)?</span></li>
				<li>Will tracing instrumentation help solve <span class="No-Break">observability problems?</span></li>
				<li>What data do I need <span class="No-Break">for dashboards?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These answers will help you determine which agent technology works best for your use case, what log formats to use, and other <span class="No-Break">important decisions.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at some of the decisions we need to make for our <span class="No-Break">data collection.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Data collection decisions</h2>
			<p>Several critical decisions<a id="_idIndexMarker1197"/> must be made early on that can impact your entire observability journey. It is important to take the time upfront to make these decisions, as it becomes a lot harder and more expensive to change them later. In most scenarios, your choices are reduced, and you have to work with existing data. That does not stop you from identifying and communicating a new standard to aim for. Standardizing data collection across the entire organization provides a framework that supports engineers in compliance. Here, we group some of those factors together to help you <span class="No-Break">process them:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Logs</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Choose a log format<a id="_idIndexMarker1198"/> that can be extended so you can deliver quickly and <span class="No-Break">enhance later.</span></li><li>Select labels carefully, considering Loki’s performance and cardinality. You can always extract additional fields as labels <span class="No-Break">during querying.</span></li><li>Consider whether valuable metrics can be created from logs (to maximize <span class="No-Break">the value).</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Metrics</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Identify important metrics, and drop <a id="_idIndexMarker1199"/>what you don’t need. This can help with metric cardinality, too. If you cannot drop the whole metric, just dropping some of the highest cardinality labels can help <span class="No-Break">a lot.</span></li><li>Choose the protocols that provide the data you need (remember, there are variations, so read the documentation for <span class="No-Break">each carefully).</span></li><li>If using verbose metric protocols, ensure protection is in place (e.g., histogram bucketing) to restrict the ability to flood <span class="No-Break">your system.</span></li><li>Add context so you can correlate metrics <span class="No-Break">with traces.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Traces</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Ensure that the accuracy of spans and traces<a id="_idIndexMarker1200"/> is implemented <span class="No-Break">and validated</span></li><li>Balance the performance and cost impact with a mitigation strategy (sampling, filtering, <span class="No-Break">and retention)</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Instrumentation libraries</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Research them well. If you are using<a id="_idIndexMarker1201"/> a library, you want it to be maintained and supported <span class="No-Break">going forward.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Telemetry collector</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Run proofs of concept to validate<a id="_idIndexMarker1202"/> what works with your technology. You don’t want to fall foul of permission constraints restricting the choice of collector on your route <span class="No-Break">to production.</span></li><li>Consider the support model that comes with the collector technology, <span class="No-Break">if any.</span></li><li>What are your business needs from <span class="No-Break">a collector?</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that all the decisions have been made, let’s look at what to do if your telemetry is not <span class="No-Break">showing up.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Debugging collector</h2>
			<p>Within the observability<a id="_idIndexMarker1203"/> platform, it can be difficult to isolate problems with your telemetry getting to the backend, especially if it is sent through different connections and components in your <span class="No-Break">telemetry pipeline.</span></p>
			<p>Here are a few steps that can help <span class="No-Break">diagnose issues:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Check for error messages in the <span class="No-Break">collector logs</span></li>
				<li>Look for data rejections by Grafana, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>Sample <span class="No-Break">too old</span></li><li>Trace <span class="No-Break">too large</span></li><li>Ingest <span class="No-Break">rate limiting</span></li></ul></li>
				<li>Validate authentication credentials (token expiry <span class="No-Break">and permissions)</span></li>
				<li>Verify how telemetry is being ingested (ports <span class="No-Break">and protocols)</span></li>
				<li>Analyze whether the telemetry is modified with sampling <span class="No-Break">or redaction</span></li>
				<li>Identify which exporters are being used to send telemetry to the <span class="No-Break">next stage</span></li>
				<li>Validate the <span class="No-Break">telemetry format</span></li>
				<li>Identify the next hop and validate <span class="No-Break">its configuration</span></li>
				<li>Test simple network connectivity and identify whether firewall rules or network policies are restricting <span class="No-Break">data flow</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We should, hopefully, have data<a id="_idIndexMarker1204"/> in the backend now, so let’s look at some best practices <span class="No-Break">with Grafana.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Best practices and troubleshooting for the Grafana stack</h1>
			<p>As with the previous section, the importance of preparation applies to the Grafana stack, as it does with any good system design. You are making decisions that affect your users, your data, and your costs. In this section, we’ll be sharing some best practices for preparing Grafana, together with some useful tips for debugging. Let’s first look at preparation activities for your <span class="No-Break">Grafana stack.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Preparing the Grafana stack</h2>
			<p>When designing your platform, consider<a id="_idIndexMarker1205"/> what you are sending there and who your users are. With your stack, it is important to consider wider subjects such as corporate authentication integration, as well as best endeavors to right-size your stack and implement processes to monitor <span class="No-Break">that usage.</span></p>
			<p>Ideally, you want to be able to answer the <span class="No-Break">following questions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who needs to use <span class="No-Break">the platform?</span></li>
				<li>Where are they using <span class="No-Break">the platform?</span></li>
				<li>What data retention requirements exist (<span class="No-Break">if any)?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Grafana stack decisions</h2>
			<p>There are important decisions<a id="_idIndexMarker1206"/> to be made before you fully embrace your Grafana stack. Not all of them are related to observability; some are affected by regional governance and some are company policy. Working on and prioritizing these decisions earlier will help with the smooth running of <span class="No-Break">your platform.</span></p>
			<p>Here, we group some of those factors together to help you <span class="No-Break">process them:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Architecture</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Does your use case require<a id="_idIndexMarker1207"/> single or multiple stacks – for instance, in the case of data residency or the separation of development and <span class="No-Break">production systems?</span></li><li>Is any data restricted<a id="_idIndexMarker1208"/> and requires specific<a id="_idIndexMarker1209"/> permissions, such as <strong class="bold">Personally Identifiable Information</strong> (<strong class="bold">PII</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">General Data Protection </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Regulation</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">GDPR</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)?</span></li><li>Are there global latency issues <span class="No-Break">to consider?</span></li><li>Are there any user <span class="No-Break">audit requirements?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Management</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Can the backend be outsourced<a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/> to ease <span class="No-Break">administration efforts?</span></li><li>Do you have the ability to fix problems in a timely manner in the case of <span class="No-Break">an incident?</span></li><li>Would IaC provide <span class="No-Break">platform control?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Authentication</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Can the platform be integrated<a id="_idIndexMarker1211"/> with an authentication provider to make user <span class="No-Break">management easier?</span></li><li>Do you have team-specific permissions that might cause issues with an <span class="No-Break">identity provider?</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Data retention</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>You need to create data retention<a id="_idIndexMarker1212"/> policies to understand why telemetry data is needed and for <span class="No-Break">how long</span></li><li>Metrics are usually cheaper to store – you can generate these from logs with recording rules rather<a id="_idIndexMarker1213"/> than store more expensive logs <span class="No-Break">for longer</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Debugging Grafana</h2>
			<p>There are a few areas or touchpoints<a id="_idIndexMarker1214"/> where problems can occur with your Grafana backend. The following techniques should help you get back on track or at least provide a point of reference to help you <span class="No-Break">debug further:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data collection</strong>: If you are having difficulties getting telemetry into Grafana, drop back to the APIs to send test data to validate network routes, API keys, and so on. This can be done with tools such as Postman or quite simply on the command line <span class="No-Break">with </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">curl</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data querying</strong>: Sometimes, queries do not give you the results you expected or provide them in a timely manner. Here are a few steps that can help solve problems or <span class="No-Break">diagnose them:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Break down large queries</strong>: Start small and build up your results, validating at each step by using short time ranges and <span class="No-Break">stronger filters</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Check function order</strong>: The order of query functions affects the outcome, in the same way that the order of equations affects the result <span class="No-Break">in math</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Speed up slow results</strong>: Results can be obtained more quickly by following <span class="No-Break">these practices:</span><ul><li>Check how many data points <span class="No-Break">there are</span></li><li>Limit the maximum data points returned in <span class="No-Break">query options</span></li><li>Increase the minimum interval timeout in <span class="No-Break">query options</span></li><li>Use <strong class="source-inline">group by</strong> functions to reduce the <span class="No-Break">result set</span></li></ul></li></ul><p class="list-inset">If you are trying out different variations of your query, the <strong class="bold">Query history</strong> button will remember them <span class="No-Break">for you.</span></p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Problem discovery</strong>: It is not always obvious where problems lie – unless, of course, people report them. Grafana provides a set of dashboards to support your success with Grafana Cloud. Here is a screenshot of the Grafana Cloud <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> list:</span></li>
			</ul>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer186" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1 – Grafana Cloud Dashboards</p>
			<p>When diagnosing problems<a id="_idIndexMarker1215"/> with your Grafana data and dashboards, the <strong class="bold">Usage Insights</strong> dashboards can help. Navigate to the <strong class="bold">Usage Insights – 1 – Overview</strong> dashboard and scroll down; you will find <span class="No-Break">three panels:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Top 10 dashboards with errors</strong>: This lets you know which dashboards are encountering errors of <span class="No-Break">some form.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Top 10 data sources with errors</strong>: This reports the Grafana data sources that have issues. This is useful to diagnose errors with queries, or in communicating to the backend <span class="No-Break">data source.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Top 10 users seeing errors</strong>: This identifies your platform users who are encountering problems inside Grafana. This is helpful when investigating <span class="No-Break">platform stability.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These panels guide you to the issues being encountered with drill-down links into other dashboards to show specific errors to <span class="No-Break">aid diagnosis.</span></p>
			<p>In particular, the <strong class="bold">Grafana Cloud Billing/Usage</strong> dashboard is very important in showing why samples might be rejected due to hitting account limits. Additionally, the <strong class="bold">Cardinality management</strong> dashboards<a id="_idIndexMarker1216"/> can help highlight problems where label values are <span class="No-Break">causing issues.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s now look at problems that we could encounter in the wider subject <span class="No-Break">of observability.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Avoiding pitfalls of observability</h1>
			<p>We have identified several areas throughout this book<a id="_idIndexMarker1217"/> where you need to sit down and think about your approach. All of these considerations contribute to your ongoing success with your observability platform. We will now call out a few of these, with some guidelines <span class="No-Break">to follow:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Treat your platform as an evolving development; start with the basics and build upon that, continuously reviewing where you are. Reducing the time to value will ensure return on investment is <span class="No-Break">being realized.</span></li>
				<li>Collect requirements from multiple customers and then plan a roadmap that will deliver more value to more users to ensure the adoption and support of <span class="No-Break">your platform.</span></li>
				<li>Monitor costs, paying close attention to the data collection stage, where it is cheaper to fix. Use your observability tools <span class="No-Break">to help.</span></li>
				<li>Fix cardinality early, and develop standards that teams can work to that will control the problem. Additionally, you can apply governance that restricts data collection into the platform if it does not adhere <span class="No-Break">to standards.</span></li>
				<li>Isolate high-load, low-value environments (especially performance test environments) to protect business-critical system observability. You can build cheaper, short-lived observability systems for these environments to keep costs <span class="No-Break">under control.</span></li>
				<li>Define a 6- and 12-month roadmap. This will help you plan for and adapt to industry changes. Observability is moving fast, with new developments coming all the time; being agile will help you <span class="No-Break">navigate them.</span></li>
				<li>Monitor platform usage. Grafana provides some excellent dashboards, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 15</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em>, that help you understand what is being used and how. Additionally, you can enhance this by improving the monitoring of your collector estate to create visibility of your entire <span class="No-Break">telemetry</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1218"/></span><span class="No-Break"> pipeline.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s now look to the future and think about where observability could <span class="No-Break">be heading.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Future trends in application monitoring</h1>
			<p>It is difficult to present a perspective<a id="_idIndexMarker1219"/> on future trends without being opinionated, so the following opinions reflect my beliefs on where the industry <span class="No-Break">is heading:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost reduction</strong>: At the time of writing, companies are actively looking at ways to reduce operational expenditure. There is a lot of scope for cost reduction in observability systems. Grafana is leading the charge with this. Take a look at <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>The <strong class="bold">Grafana Cloud Billing/Usage</strong> dashboard to get an understanding of Grafana Cloud spend. This dashboard is part of the list shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 15.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Adaptative Metrics</strong> (<a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/cost-management-and-billing/reduce-costs/metrics-costs/control-metrics-usage-via-adaptive-metrics/">https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/cost-management-and-billing/reduce-costs/metrics-costs/control-metrics-usage-via-adaptive-metrics/</a>) for solutions to <span class="No-Break">reducing</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker1220"/></span><span class="No-Break"> costs.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Log Volume Explorer</strong> (<a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/cost-management-and-billing/analyze-costs/logs-costs/analyze-log-ingestion-log-volume-explorer/">https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/cost-management-and-billing/analyze-costs/logs-costs/analyze-log-ingestion-log-volume-explorer/</a>) to discover sources with <a id="_idIndexMarker1221"/>excessive <span class="No-Break">log collection.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>): AI has matured recently to a point<a id="_idIndexMarker1222"/> where it will soon become a key part of observability platforms. Grafana recently released generative AI features for the <strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong> panel title and description text and incident response auto summaries. You can see and read<a id="_idIndexMarker1223"/> more here: <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2023/08/28/generative-ai-at-grafana-labs-whats-new-whats-next-and-our-vision-for-the-open-source-community/">https://grafana.com/blog/2023/08/28/generative-ai-at-grafana-labs-whats-new-whats-next-and-our-vision-for-the-open-source-community/</a>. Hot off the press as we go to press with this book, Grafana<a id="_idIndexMarker1224"/> announced the acquisition of <strong class="bold">Asserts.ai</strong> delivering root cause analysis solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker1225"/> into Grafana; you can learn more <span class="No-Break">here: </span><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2023/11/14/grafana-labs-acquires-asserts/"><span class="No-Break">https://grafana.com/blog/2023/11/14/grafana-labs-acquires-asserts/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tool enhancements</strong>: Capabilities to improve the relationship between developers and observability, easing the adoption earlier in the development life cycle. Grafana<a id="_idIndexMarker1226"/> recently released live dashboard development with a VS Code Grafana <span class="No-Break">extension: </span><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Grafana.grafana-vscode"><span class="No-Break">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Grafana.grafana-vscode</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">OpenTelemetry standard maturity</strong>: Increased third-party development supporting OpenTelemetry<a id="_idIndexMarker1227"/> as standards are agreed upon. Vendor-neutral solutions are becoming more popular, helping reduce overall costs (operational <span class="No-Break">and management).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collector management</strong>: Here are some configuration and control tools for <span class="No-Break">agent technology:</span><ul><li><strong class="bold">Open Agent Management Protocol</strong> (<a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/opamp/">https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/opamp/</a>) for the remote management of large fleets<a id="_idIndexMarker1228"/> of data collection agents. No more re-deployments to block a metric or add a <span class="No-Break">new receiver.</span></li><li><strong class="bold">Grafana Agent Flow</strong> brings new ways to build complex telemetry pipelines for the Grafana Agent. It includes a visualization of the Agent pipeline, which is perfect for understanding <span class="No-Break">complex configurations.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Platform engineering</strong>: Advancements in platform engineering will help increase observability adoption and development<a id="_idIndexMarker1229"/> as dependency on <span class="No-Break">telemetry increases.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will now wrap up this chapter and the book. You should now have the knowledge to implement, troubleshoot, and manage Grafana for your <span class="No-Break">observability journey.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have gone over best practices and troubleshooting techniques for data collection and the Grafana stack. We have looked at ways to avoid the pitfalls of observability as a whole, wrapping the chapter up with a look at future trends in application monitoring. These sections should have given you insights that will support your observability platform being a success, and help you get value from your platform for your users quicker and more efficiently. Now that we’ve completed the final chapter in our journey together through <em class="italic">Observability with Grafana</em>, let’s take a moment to review our <span class="No-Break">key learnings.</span></p>
			<p>In the first part of the book, we introduced observability and Grafana, along with a look at application and infrastructure instrumentation. We closed that part by setting up the OpenTelemetry demonstration application in your own <span class="No-Break">Kubernetes environment.</span></p>
			<p>In part two, we worked through different telemetry types that you will encounter with Grafana – Loki for logs, Prometheus (Mimir) for metrics, and Tempo for traces – together making <strong class="bold">LGTM</strong> (<strong class="bold">Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir</strong>), which you will see all over the Grafana website. We then looked at integrations with Kubernetes (which we used with the demo app throughout the book), AWS, GCP, <span class="No-Break">and Azure.</span></p>
			<p>In part three, we worked with Grafana more, presenting data with dashboards and building an incident management process with alerts. We then explored IaC for configuring Grafana, followed by a look at the architecture of the <span class="No-Break">Grafana stack.</span></p>
			<p>In our final part, we talked about real user monitoring with Grafana frontend observability, application profiling with Grafana Pyroscope, and performance testing with Grafana K6. We closed the book with a look at how DevOps can be supported with observability, followed by some best practices and troubleshooting in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Technology in the observability space, and especially with Grafana, moves fast. Hopefully, we have provided you with some timeless approaches and techniques that you can develop to support your observability work. Your new friends, the observability personas, will be there to lend a hand when you need it. Thank you for allowing us to be part of this journey with you. <span class="No-Break">Good luck!</span></p>
