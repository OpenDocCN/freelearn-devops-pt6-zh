			<p>Edge computing consists of processing data near to the source where this data is generated. In order to build an edge computing system, you must understand the different layers and components that an edge system uses to process the information. Using K3s a lightweight Kubernetes, you can take advantage of the use of containers to design distributed system and automate the way that your applications are updated. This book will gives you all the necessary tools to create your own edge system across learning the basics and different use cases of edge computing. By the end of this book, you will understand how to implement your own edge computing system that uses containers with K3s for your Kubernetes clusters and cloud native open source software. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for operations or DevOps engineers looking to move their data processing tasks to the edge or for those engineers looking to implement an edge computing system, but they don’t have the technology background to do so. It can also be used for enthusiast and entrepreneurs looking to implement or experiment with edge computing for different or potential use case scenarios.</p>
