- en: Containerization is currently known to be one of the best ways to implement
    DevOps. While Docker introduced containers and changed the DevOps era, Google
    developed an extensive container orchestration system, Kubernetes, which is now
    considered the industry standard. With the help of this book, you’ll explore the
    efficiency of managing applications running on Kubernetes using Helm.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting with a brief introduction to Helm and its impact on users working with
    containers and Kubernetes, you’ll delve into the primitives of Helm charts and
    its overall architecture and use cases. From there, you’ll learn how to write
    Helm charts in order to automate application deployment on Kubernetes and work
    your way toward more advanced strategies. These enterprise-ready patterns are
    focused on concepts beyond the basics so that you can get the most out of Helm,
    including topics related to automation, application development, delivery, life
    cycle management, and security.
