			<p><st c="8">In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, </st><strong class="bold"><st c="60">Amazon Web Services</st></strong><st c="79"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="81">AWS</st></strong><st c="84">) stands as the leader, offering a collection of services that empower businesses and developers. </st><st c="183">But for you, AWS can be more than a technology platform; it can be a gateway to a thriving job market. </st><st c="286">So, whether you are an aspiring cloud engineer, a seasoned developer, or an IT professional, if you want to level up your skills on AWS, this book is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="436">for you.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="444">This book’s approach is project-focused, with each chapter guiding you through the implementation of real-world scenarios using AWS services. </st><st c="587">From setting up basic infrastructure to host a website to leveraging advanced features such as serverless computing and machine learning to power a chatbot, the projects in this book are tailored to equip you with the skills required to tackle the challenges you will face in the field. </st><st c="874">But there’s more – you will also learn about alternative services and architectures that you can use to accomplish the same business objectives because, in the end, it’s all about weighing up the pros </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1075">and cons.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1084">By the end of this book, you will feel confident in your hands-on AWS capabilities and be able to build your own cloud projects. </st><st c="1214">You will be an eye-catching </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1242">AWS expert.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/><st c="1253">Who this book is for</st></h1>
			<p><st c="1274">This book was written for students who want to start their career in cloud computing and professionals who have experience in other technical areas such as software development but want to embrace a new professional path or complement their technical skills in cloud computing. </st><st c="1553">If you are either, this book is </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1585">for you.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1593">Being a practical book, a background in computer science or engineering and basic programming skills are recommended but not mandatory. </st><st c="1730">All the projects come with theoretical explanations of the services used and do not assume any previous </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1834">AWS knowledge.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/><st c="1848">What this book covers</st></h1>
			<p><a href="B22051_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="1870">Chapter 1</st></em></span></a><st c="1880">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="1882">Deploying and Interacting with AWS Services</st></em><st c="1925">, explains how using the AWS console is a good starting point, but there are more advanced options that will help you manage your resources in a scalable way. </st><st c="2084">In this chapter, you will learn the different ways to create and manage AWS resources. </st><st c="2171">You will also learn about the AWS CLI and SDKs and get familiar with Infrastructure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2255">as Code.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor032"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="2263">Chapter 2</st></em></span></a><st c="2273">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="2275">Creating a Personal Website</st></em><st c="2302">, as the first practical chapter, introduces what you are going to build: a personal website to use as your CV. </st><st c="2414">This is followed by an architectural diagram of the solution, accompanied by step-by-step instructions on how to build it on your own AWS account. </st><st c="2561">This chapter ends with suggestions to improve the application you </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2627">have built.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor054"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="2638">Chapter 3</st></em></span></a><st c="2648">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="2650">Building a Recipe-Sharing Application</st></em><st c="2687">, covers how to build a recipe-sharing application. </st><st c="2739">You will learn about how dynamic applications are built, and how to interact with databases. </st><st c="2832">It’s structured in the same way as the previous chapter, starting with a description of the new functionality followed by the technical architecture, and step-by-step instructions on how to build and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3032">test it.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor089"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="3040">Chapter 4</st></em></span></a><st c="3050">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3052">Building a Serverless Recipe-Sharing Application</st></em><st c="3100">, rebuilds the recipe-sharing application, but with a twist. </st><st c="3161">Much like in the previous chapter, this is a dynamic web application. </st><st c="3231">However, this time, you are going to only use serverless services. </st><st c="3298">Because of the confidentiality nature of the project, you are also going to add an </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3381">authentication mechanism.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor123"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="3406">Chapter 5</st></em></span></a><st c="3416">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3418">Implementing an Image Analyzer to Detect Photo Friendliness</st></em><st c="3477">, covers how, before choosing your CV photo, you ask for feedback from your peers to see how friendly it looks, so what if you could do it automatically? </st><st c="3631">Let’s say that every time you upload a new photo, your application automatically rates it in terms of friendliness and suggests whether it is a good fit for a professional CV. </st><st c="3807">In this chapter, you will build this functionality using AWS-native </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3875">AI services.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="3887">Chapter 6</st></em></span></a><st c="3897">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="3899">Architecting a Content Translation Pipeline</st></em><st c="3942">, covers accessibility. </st><st c="3966">Have you accessed a website that automatically translated itself into your language? </st><st c="4051">Accessibility is important to reach wider audiences. </st><st c="4104">In this chapter, you will learn how to automatically have your content translated to multiple languages using a CI/CD pipeline and then dynamically served using your users’ </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4277">browser preferences.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="4297">Chapter 7</st></em></span></a><st c="4307">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="4309">Implementing a Chatbot Using Machine Learning</st></em><st c="4354">, explores the use of chatbots. </st><st c="4386">Everyone has heard of ChatGPT. </st><st c="4417">In this chapter, you will build a virtual assistant that answers queries related to web development. </st><st c="4518">This virtual assistant is powered by the newest machine learning advancements: large </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4603">language models.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor227"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="4619">Chapter 8</st></em></span></a><st c="4629">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="4631">Building a Business Intelligence Application</st></em><st c="4675">, explains how, more than building web applications, you can also build business intelligence solutions to analyze data and identify trends. </st><st c="4816">In this chapter, you will use AWS-native services to analyze clickstream data. </st><st c="4895">Clickstream data is collected when users access websites and applications. </st><st c="4970">Understanding it allows application owners to better tailor their content to their audience. </st><st c="5063">At the end of this chapter, you will be ready to query, transform, and visualize several formats </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5160">with ease.</st></span></p>
			<p><a href="B22051_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor251"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><st c="5170">Chapter 9</st></em></span></a><st c="5180">, </st><em class="italic"><st c="5182">Exploring Future Work</st></em><st c="5203">, explains how, in AWS, there are more than 200 services that you can use to power your applications. </st><st c="5305">Unlike the previous chapters, which had step-by-step instructions to build applications, this chapter has an overview of what AWS has to offer and strategies to accelerate and support your project ideas. </st><st c="5509">This chapter is not a practical one, it is inspirational; use it to brainstorm your next </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5598">big project.</st></span></p>
