- en: Hello and welcome! *Observability with Grafana* is a book about the tools offered
    by Grafana Labs for observability and monitoring. Grafana Labs is an industry-leading
    provider of open source tools to collect, store, and visualize data collected
    from IT systems. This book is primarily aimed toward IT engineers who will interact
    with these systems, whatever discipline they work in.

    environment and send the collected data to a free Grafana Cloud account that we
    will create. This will guide you through the Grafana tools for collecting telemetry
    and also give you hands-on experience using the administration and support tools
    offered by Grafana. This approach will teach you how to run the Grafana tools
    in a way so that anyone can experiment and learn independently.
