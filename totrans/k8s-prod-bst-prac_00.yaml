- en: Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration platform originally developed
    by Google and made available to the public in 2014\. The popularity of Kubernetes
    helped to make the deployment of container-based, complex, distributed systems
    simpler to manage for developers. Since its inception, the community has built
    a large ecosystem around Kubernetes, with many open source projects that have
    made the automation of management functions possible.

- en: This book is specifically designed to quickly help Kubernetes administrators
    and **site reliability engineers** (**SREs**) to build and manage production-grade
    Kubernetes infrastructure following industry best practices and well-proven techniques
    learned from early technology adopters of large-scale Kubernetes deployments.

- en: While we use Amazon **Elastic Kubernetes Service** (**EKS**) to deliver the
    practical exercises in this book, we believe that the explained Kubernetes design,
    provisioning, and configuration concepts and techniques remain valid for other
    cloud providers. Regarding the selection of provisioning and configuration tools,
    we decided to use cloud-agnostic tools such as Terraform and Ansible to ensure
    portability across cloud providers.
