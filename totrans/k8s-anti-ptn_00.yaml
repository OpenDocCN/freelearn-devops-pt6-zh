- en: 'Hello there! Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications
    across a cluster of machines. It is a critical tool for modern software deployment,
    allowing for high availability, scaling, and efficient application management.
    However, navigating Kubernetes can be challenging, especially when common pitfalls—known
    as anti-patterns—threaten the stability, efficiency, and security of applications.
    This book, *Kubernetes Anti-Patterns: Avert Potential Pitfalls Through a Practitioner’s
    Lens*, is dedicated to uncovering these pitfalls, understanding their implications,
    and learning how to avoid or mitigate them effectively.'

- en: While numerous resources cover Kubernetes’ basics and advanced features, there’s
    a gap in literature specifically focused on anti-patterns. This book aims to fill
    that gap by providing a comprehensive guide on identifying anti-patterns, understanding
    their impacts, and adopting best practices to avert these issues. Based on my
    experience as a Kubernetes and cloud architect, combined with insights from leading
    Kubernetes professionals across various industries, this book offers practical
    advice and strategies derived from real-world scenarios.
