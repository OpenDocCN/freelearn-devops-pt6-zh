<p>Before plunging into how Kubernetes works, this book introduces you to the world of container orchestration and describes the recent changes in application development. It helps you understand the problems that Kubernetes solves and shows how to use Kubernetes resources to deploy applications. You also learn to apply the security model of Kubernetes clusters. The book also describes how services running in Kubernetes can leverage the platform's security features. You learn to troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters and debug Kubernetes applications. You also learn to analyze the networking model and its alternatives in Kubernetes, and apply best practices in Kubernetes with design patterns. By the time you are done reading the book, you will know all about using the power of Kubernetes for managing your containers.</p>
<p class="mce-root">After completing this book, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Understand and classify software designs patterns per the cloud-native paradigm</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Apply best practices in Kubernetes with design patterns</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Access Kubernetes API programmatically using client libraries</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Extend Kubernetes with custom resources and controllers</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Integrate into access control mechanisms and interact resource lifecycle in Kubernetes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Develop and run custom schedulers in Kubernetes</li>
</ul>

<p><span>We assume that you are comfortable with command-line tools and computer programming concepts and languages.</span><span> </span>The minimum hardware requirements are: <span>Intel Core i7 or equivalent, 8 </span><span>GB RAM, 35</span><span> GB hard disk, and a</span><span> stable internet connection. </span>You'll also need the following software installed in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Access to a Kubernetes cluster with the version equal to or higher than 1.10<br/>
Local Kubernetes solutions such as minikube or clusters living in cloud providers: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Kubernetes command line tool kubectl is required for accessing Kubernetes from terminal:<br/>
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Docker client and server with the minimum version of 18.03 are required for building and testing the client libraries:<br/>
<a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">https://www.docker.com/get-started</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Installing Python and Go are not required, however recommended for playing around with the client libraries locally:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://golang.org/">https://golang.org/</a></li>
