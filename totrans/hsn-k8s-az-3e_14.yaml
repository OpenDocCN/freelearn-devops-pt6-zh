- en: In the previous chapter, *Chapter 8, Role-based access control in AKS*, you
    integrated your AKS cluster with **Azure Active Directory** (**Azure AD**). You
    then assigned Kubernetes roles to users and groups in Azure AD. In this chapter,
    you will explore how you can integrate your applications running on AKS with Azure
    AD, and you will learn how you can give your pods an identity in Azure so they
    can interact with other Azure resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Azure, application identities use a functionality called service principals.
    A service principal is the equivalent of a service account in the cloud. An application
    can use a service principal to authenticate to Azure AD and get access to resources.
    Those resources could be either Azure resources such as Azure Blob Storage or
    Azure Key Vault, or they could be applications that you developed that are integrated
    with Azure AD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two ways to authenticate a service principal: you can either use
    a password or a combination of a certificate and a private key. Although these
    are secure ways to authenticate your applications, managing passwords or certificates
    and the rotation associated with them can be cumbersome.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Managed identities in Azure are a functionality that makes authenticating to
    a service principal easier. It works by assigning an identity to a compute resource
    in Azure, such as a virtual machine or an Azure function. Those compute resources
    can authenticate using that managed identity by calling an endpoint that only
    that machine can reach. This is a secure type of authentication that does not
    require you to manage passwords or certificates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure AD pod-managed identities allow you to assign managed identities to pods
    in Kubernetes. Since pods in Kubernetes run on virtual machines, by default, each
    pod would be able to access the managed identity endpoint and authenticate using
    that identity. Using Azure AD pod-managed identities, pods can no longer reach
    the internal endpoint for the virtual machine, and rather only get access to identities
    assigned to that specific pod.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you'll configure an Azure AD pod-managed identity on an AKS
    cluster and use it to get access to Azure Blob Storage. In the next chapter, you
    will then use these Azure AD pod-managed identities to get access to Azure Key
    Vault and manage Kubernetes secrets.

- en: The Azure AD pod-managed identities add-on for AKS configures your cluster in
    such a way that pods can no longer access the IMDS endpoint directly to request
    an access token. It configures your cluster in such a way that pods trying to
    access to IMDS endpoint (1) will connect to a DaemonSet running on the cluster.
    This DaemonSet is called the **node managed identity** (**NMI**). The NMI will
    verify which identities that pod should have access to. If the pod is configured
    to have access to the requested identity, then the DaemonSet will connect to the
    IMDS (2 to 5) to get the token, and then deliver the token to the pod (6). The
    pods can then use this token to access Azure resources (7).

- en: In this chapter, you've continued your exploration of security in AKS. Whereas
    *Chapter 8, Role-based access control in AKS*, focused on identities for users,
    this chapter focused on identities for pods and applications running in pods.
    You learned about managed identities in Azure and how you can use Azure AD pod-managed
    identities in Azure to assign those managed identities to pods.

- en: You created a new cluster with the Azure AD pod-managed identities add-on enabled.
    You then created a new managed identity and linked that to your cluster. In the
    final section, you gave this identity permissions over a blob storage account
    and finally verified that pods with the managed identity were able to log in to
    Azure and download files, but pods without the managed identity couldn't log in
    to Azure.

    about the built-in secrets and then also learn how you can securely connect Kubernetes
    to Azure Key Vault, and even use Azure AD pod-managed identities to do this.
