			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>In the last few years, countless organizations have taken advantage of the disruptive application deployment operating model provided by Kubernetes. With the launch of Crossplane, the same benefits are coming to the world of infrastructure provisioning and management. The limitations of infrastructure as code, with respect to drift management, role-based access control, team collaboration, and weak contracts, have made people move toward control plane-based infrastructure automation, but setting it up requires a lot of know-how and effort.</p>
			<p>This book will cover a detailed journey to building a control plane-based infrastructure automation platform with Kubernetes and Crossplane. The cloud-native landscape has an overwhelming list of configuration management tools, which can make it difficult to analyze and choose the right one. This book will guide cloud-native practitioners to select the right tools for Kubernetes configuration management that best suit the use case. You’ll learn about configuration management with hands-on modules built on popular configuration management tools, such as Helm, Kustomize, Argo, and KubeVela. The hands-on examples will be guides that you can directly use in your day-to-day work.</p>
			<p>By the end of this DevOps book, you’ll have be well versed in building a modern infrastructure automation platform to unify application and infrastructure automation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for cloud architects, platform engineers, infrastructure or application operators, and Kubernetes enthusiasts interested in simplifying infrastructure and application automation. A basic understanding of Kubernetes and its building blocks, such as Pod, Deployment, Service, and namespace, is needed before you can get started with this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B17830_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing the New Operating Model</em>, discusses how, for many people, Kubernetes is all about container orchestration. But Kubernetes is much more than that. Understanding the deciding factors on why Kubernetes disrupted the day 1 and day 2 IT operations is key to successful adoption and optimum usage.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Examining the State of Infrastructure Automation</em>, exposes the limitations of infrastructure as code and proposes control plane-based infrastructure automation as the new-age automation concept using Crossplane and Kubernetes.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor039"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automating Infrastructure with Crossplane</em>, helps us to understand how to set up a Crossplane cluster, discusses its architecture, and explains how to use it as a vanilla flavor for infrastructure automation.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Composing Infrastructure with Crossplane</em>, helps us to understand composing, a powerful construct of Crossplane that can help us to create new infrastructure abstractions. These abstractions can be our custom Kubernetes-based cloud APIs with the organization policies, compliance requirements, and recipes baked into them.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor074"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Infrastructure Platform Patterns</em>, looks at how the success of running an infrastructure platform product within an organization requires a few key patterns that we can use with Crossplane. This chapter will explore these patterns in detail.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor092"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">More Crossplane Patterns</em>, explores more Crossplane patterns that are useful for our day-to-day work. We will learn about most of these patterns with a hands-on journey.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Extending and Scaling Crossplane</em>, covers two unique aspects that make Crossplane extendable and scalable. The first part will deep dive into the Crossplane providers, and the second part will cover how Crossplane can work in a multi-tenant ecosystem.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Knowing the Trade-Offs</em>, discusses how managing configuration has many nuances to it. Understanding the configuration clock will help us to categorize tools and understand the trade-offs applicable for each category.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor144"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Helm, Kustomize, and KubeVela</em>, concentrates on explaining how to use different configuration management tools that are popular today, such as Helm, Kustomize, and KubeVela.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Onboarding Applications with Crossplane</em>, looks at how infrastructure provisioning and application onboarding involve a few cross-cutting concerns, such as setting up the source code repositories, the continuous integration workflow, and continuous deployment. This chapter will look at ways to approach application, services, and infrastructure automation with Crossplane in a unified way.</p>
			<p><a href="B17830_11_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor168"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Driving the Platform Adoption</em>, explains that many organizations fail with their technology platform projects because they don’t apply the needed product development practices and team topology. This chapter aims to help understand the aspects required to build and adopt a successful infrastructure platform.</p>

			<p>Please go through the documentation at <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/">https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/</a> to understand the basic concepts. All code examples are tested using the Kind Kubernetes cluster (<a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/</a> - v1.21.1) and Crossplane version 1.5.0 as the control plane. However, they should work with future version releases too.</p>
