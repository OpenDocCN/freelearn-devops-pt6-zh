- en: Kubernetes is an open source system that automates the deployment, scaling,
    and management of containerized applications. If you are running more than just
    a few containers or want to automate the management of your containers, you need
    Kubernetes. This book focuses on guiding you through the advanced management of
    Kubernetes clusters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book begins by explaining the fundamentals behind Kubernetes’ architecture
    and covers Kubernetes’ design in detail. You will discover how to run complex
    stateful microservices on Kubernetes, including advanced features such as horizontal
    pod autoscaling, rolling updates, resource quotas, and persistent storage backends.
    Using real-world use cases, you will explore the options for network configuration
    and understand how to set up, operate, secure, and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters.
    Finally, you will learn about advanced topics such as custom resources, API aggregation,
    service meshes, and serverless computing. All the content is up to date and complies
    with Kubernetes 1.26\. By the end of this book, you’ll know everything you need
    to know to go from intermediate to advanced level.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Understanding Kubernetes Architecture*, in this chapter, we will
    build together the foundation necessary to utilize Kubernetes to its full potential.
    We will start by understanding what Kubernetes is, what Kubernetes isn’t, and
    what container orchestration means exactly. Then we will cover important Kubernetes
    concepts that will form the vocabulary we will use throughout the book.'

    up our sleeves and build some Kubernetes clusters using minikube, KinD, and k3d.
    We will discuss and evaluate other tools such as kubeadm and Kubespray. We will
    also look into deployment environments such as local, cloud, and bare metal.'

    dive into the topic of highly available clusters. This is a complicated topic.
    The Kubernetes project and the community haven’t settled on one true way to achieve
    high-availability nirvana.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many aspects to highly available Kubernetes clusters, such as ensuring
    that the control plane can keep functioning in the face of failures, protecting
    the cluster state in etcd, protecting the system’s data, and recovering capacity
    and/or performance quickly. Different systems will have different reliability
    and availability requirements.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Securing Kubernetes*, in this chapter, we will explore the important
    topic of security. Kubernetes clusters are complicated systems composed of multiple
    layers of interacting components. The isolation and compartmentalization of different
    layers is very important when running critical applications. To secure the system
    and ensure proper access to resources, capabilities, and data, we must first understand
    the unique challenges facing Kubernetes as a general-purpose orchestration platform
    that runs unknown workloads. Then we can take advantage of various securities,
    isolation, and access control mechanisms to make sure the cluster, the applications
    running on it, and the data are all safe. We will discuss various best practices
    and when it is appropriate to use each mechanism.'

- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Using Kubernetes Resources in Practice*, in this chapter, we
    will design a fictional massive-scale platform that will challenge Kubernetes’
    capabilities and scalability. The Hue platform is all about creating an omniscient
    and omnipotent digital assistant. Hue is a digital extension of you. Hue will
    help you do anything, find anything, and, in many cases, will do a lot on your
    behalf. It will obviously need to store a lot information, integrate with many
    external services, respond to notifications and events, and be smart about interacting
    with you.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Managing Storage*, in this chapter, we’ll look at how Kubernetes
    manages storage. Storage is very different from computation, but at a high level,
    they are both resources. Kubernetes as a generic platform takes the approach of
    abstracting storage behind a programming model and a set of plugins for storage
    providers.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Running Stateful Applications with Kubernetes*, in this chapter,
    we will learn how to run stateful applications on Kubernetes. Kubernetes takes
    a lot of work out of our hands by automatically starting and restarting pods across
    the cluster nodes as needed, based on complex requirements and configurations
    such as namespaces, limits, and quotas. But when pods run storage-aware software,
    such as databases and queues, relocating a pod can cause the system to break.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Deploying and Updating Applications*, in this chapter, we will
    explore the automated pod scalability that Kubernetes provides, how it affects
    rolling updates, and how it interacts with quotas. We will touch on the important
    topic of provisioning and how to choose and manage the size of the cluster. Finally,
    we will go over how the Kubernetes team improved the performance of Kubernetes
    and how they test the limits of Kubernetes with the Kubemark tool.'

- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Packaging Applications*, in this chapter, we are going to look
    into Helm, the Kubernetes package manager. Every successful and non-trivial platform
    must have a good packaging system. Helm was developed by Deis (acquired by Microsoft
    on April 4, 2017) and later contributed to the Kubernetes project directly. It
    became a CNCF project in 2018\. We will start by understanding the motivation
    for Helm, its architecture, and its components.'

    the important topic of networking. Kubernetes, as an orchestration platform, manages
    containers/pods running on different machines (physical or virtual) and requires
    an explicit networking model.'

- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Running Kubernetes on Multiple Clusters*, in this chapter, we’ll
    take it to the next level, by running Kubernetes on multiple clouds and clusters.
    A Kubernetes cluster is a closely knit unit where all the components run in relative
    proximity and are connected by a fast network (typically a physical data center
    or cloud provider availability zone). This is great for many use cases, but there
    are several important use cases where systems need to scale beyond a single cluster.'

- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Serverless Computing on Kubernetes*, in this chapter, we will
    explore the fascinating world of serverless computing in the cloud. The term “serverless”
    is getting a lot of attention, but it is a misnomer used to describe two different
    paradigms. A true serverless application runs as a web application in the user’s
    browser or a mobile app and only interacts with external services. The types of
    serverless systems we build on Kubernetes are different.'

    to talk about how to make sure your systems are up and running and performing
    correctly and how to respond when they aren’t. In *Chapter 3,* *High Availability
    and Reliability*, we discussed related topics. The focus here is about knowing
    what’s going on in your system and what practices and tools you can use.'

- en: '*Chapter 14*, *Utilizing Service Meshes*, in this chapter, we will learn how
    service meshes allow you to externalize cross-cutting concerns like monitoring
    and observability from the application code. The service mesh is a true paradigm
    shift in the way you can design, evolve, and operate distributed systems on Kubernetes.
    I like to think of it as aspect-oriented programming for cloud-native distributed
    systems.'

    the guts of Kubernetes. We will start with the Kubernetes API and learn how to
    work with Kubernetes programmatically via direct access to the API, the Go client,
    and automating kubectl. Then we’ll look into extending the Kubernetes API with
    custom resources. The last part is all about the various plugins Kubernetes supports.
    Many aspects of Kubernetes operation are modular and designed for extension. We
    will examine the API aggregation layer and several types of plugins, such as custom
    schedulers, authorization, admission control, custom metrics, and volumes. Finally,
    we’ll look into extending kubectl and adding your own commands.'

    mostly on the compute side, which is the most fundamental and dominant.'

    future of Kubernetes from multiple angles. We’ll start with the momentum of Kubernetes
    since its inception, across dimensions such as community, ecosystem, and mindshare.
    Spoiler alert: Kubernetes won the container orchestration wars by a landslide.
    As Kubernetes grows and matures, the battle lines shift from beating competitors
    to fighting against its own complexity. Usability, tooling, and education will
    play a major role as container orchestration is still new, fast-moving, and not
    a well-understood domain. Then we will take a look at some very interesting patterns
    and trends.'
