    as a dynamic ecosystem where clusters and components interact to deliver applications
    and services. For instance, a misconfigured application in one cluster can create
    a surge in traffic to other clusters, leading to resource shortages and potentially
    affecting service quality for multiple users.

    resources is pivotal. Clusters often act as nodes in a network, sharing a common
    pool of vital resources, including network bandwidth, storage, and computational
    power. These shared resources ensure the smooth operation of applications and
    services, facilitating seamless interactions between clusters and components.
  prefs: []

    overconsumption due to misconfigurations or inefficient resource usage can lead
    to a significant imbalance within a cluster. As a result, this cluster starts
    consuming a disproportionate number of shared resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    cluster. It propagates across the Kubernetes ecosystem, impacting interconnected
    clusters and their applications. As the overburdened cluster strains shared resources,
    it causes resource scarcity in other clusters. The result is a cascading effect,
    whereby performance degradation becomes pervasive.

    burden. Applications and services running in interconnected clusters experience
    slowdowns, service interruptions, and increased latency. The entire Kubernetes
    ecosystem begins to show signs of inefficiency, affecting user experiences and
    the ability to meet operational demands.
