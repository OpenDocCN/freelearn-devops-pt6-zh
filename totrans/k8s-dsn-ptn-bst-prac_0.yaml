- en: Before plunging into how Kubernetes works, this book introduces you to the world
    of container orchestration and describes the recent changes in application development.
    It helps you understand the problems that Kubernetes solves and shows how to use
    Kubernetes resources to deploy applications. You also learn to apply the security
    model of Kubernetes clusters. The book also describes how services running in
    Kubernetes can leverage the platform's security features. You learn to troubleshoot
    Kubernetes clusters and debug Kubernetes applications. You also learn to analyze
    the networking model and its alternatives in Kubernetes, and apply best practices
    in Kubernetes with design patterns. By the time you are done reading the book,
    you will know all about using the power of Kubernetes for managing your containers.
