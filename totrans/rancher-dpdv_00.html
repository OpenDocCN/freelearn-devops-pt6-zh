			<p>Rancher and Kubernetes have been driving the wave of DevOps adoption for both on-premises and cloud workloads. This book will guide you through the history of Rancher and Kubernetes and how they came into being. We will dive into how to design, build, and manage your Rancher environment. We will then build upon Rancher, deploying a range of cluster types, including RKE, RKE2, k3s, EKS, and GKE. With each of these cluster types, we will go over how they work, design a solution around them, and finally, deploy them using Rancher.</p>
			<p>We will then shift into getting your clusters production-ready. This includes how we back up and restore the different cluster types and monitor the health of our clusters and the application hosted on them. Then, we will dive into how to provide the additional services needed outside of core Kubernetes services, including persistent storage with Longhorn, security/compliance using OPA Gatekeeper, and how to bring dynamic scaling to our clusters.</p>
			<p>We will then close the book by covering how to build and deploy our application in a Rancher/Kubernetes ecosystem using tools such as Drone CI for our CI/CD pipeline and Harbor for hosting build artifacts. We will then dive into the deep topic of Helm charts and how they bring package management to our clusters. Finally, we will close by covering resource management and cost reporting to address the goal of turning IT from a black hole into which you throw money into the profit center it can be.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book primarily targets DevOps engineers looking to deploy Kubernetes with Rancher, including how Rancher changed how clusters are built and managed using RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) and RKE2/k3s. It is also for people who want to learn more about the Day 2 task part of the Kubernetes and Rancher ecosystem.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book assumes that you have a basic understanding of Linux server administration, including basic Bash scripting, installing packages, and automating tasks at scale. In addition, we are going to assume that you have a basic understanding of most cloud platforms, such as AWS, GCP, vSphere, or Azure.</p>

			<p>It is also recommended to have a lab environment to deploy Rancher and RKE1/2 clusters. An important note: most cloud providers offer trail credits that should be more than enough to spin up small lab clusters.</p>
			<p>Finally, Kubernetes and Rancher are ever-changing, so it is important to remember that version numbers will need to be changed as time moves on. So, it is highly recommended to review the release notes of each product and software before picking a version.</p>
