- en: This part will cover setting up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications
    into a Rancher cluster, including a supporting service such as an image registry
    and Helm charts. In addition, we will cover how to expose applications to the
    outside world using ingress rules, including SSL certificates to protect communication
    between applications. Finally, we will cover how performance capacity planning
    and management can be applied and enforced in Rancher.
