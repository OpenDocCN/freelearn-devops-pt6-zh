    intelligent systems by enabling machines to create content, code, text, images,
    and more. As demand for large-scale AI applications continues to grow, **Kubernetes**
    (**K8s**) has become the de facto platform to manage these workloads with scalability,
    resilience, and efficiency.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide for building, deploying,
    monitoring, and scaling GenAI applications on Kubernetes using Amazon EKS and
    other open source and cloud-native tools. From foundational concepts to advanced
    GPU optimization, the book addresses the lifecycle of GenAI projects with practical
    examples, deployment patterns, and industry best practices.
