    the security of a Kubernetes-managed cluster (*Kubernetes*, by the way, is Greek
    for *helmsman*, as in the helmsman of a *ship*). If your cluster is left open
    with the wrong ports or services exposed, or plain text is used for secrets in
    application definitions, bad actors can take advantage of this negligent security
    and do pretty much whatever they want in your cluster.'

    (**AKS**) cluster and workloads running on top of it. In this section, you will
    learn about four ways to secure your cluster and applications. You will learn
    about role-based access control in Kubernetes and how this can be integrated with
    **Azure Active Directory** (**Azure AD**). After that, you'll learn how to allow
    your pods to get access to Azure resources such as Blob Storage or Key Vault using
    an Azure AD pod identity. Subsequently, you'll learn about Kubernetes secrets
    and how to safely integrate them with Key Vault. Finally, you'll learn about network
    security and how to isolate your Kubernetes cluster.

    with new functionalities enabled. The reason you will delete existing clusters
    is to save costs and optimize the free trial, if you are using it.
