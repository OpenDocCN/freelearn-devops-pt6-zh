			<p>Welcome! By picking up this book, you've shown that you are interested in two things: Azure and Kubernetes, which are both near and dear to my heart. I'm excited that you are joining us on our cloud-native journey. Whether you are new to Azure, new to Kubernetes, or new to both, I'm confident that as you explore Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you will find new ways to transform your applications, delight your customers, meet the growing needs of your business, or simply learn new skills that will help you achieve your career goals. Regardless of your reasons for starting this journey, we are eager to help you along the way and see what you can build with Kubernetes and Azure.</p>
			<p>The journey of Kubernetes on Azure itself has been an exciting one. Over the last few years, AKS has been the fastest-growing service in the history of Azure. We find ourselves at the inflection point of both hyperscale growth in Azure itself, as well as hockey stick growth in applications running on Kubernetes. Combine the two together, and this has made for an exciting (and busy) few years.</p>
			<p>It has been thrilling to see the success that we have been able to deliver for our customers and users. But what is it about Azure and Kubernetes that have enabled customer success? Though it may seem like magic at times, the truth is that there is nothing about either Azure or Kubernetes that is truly magic. The value, success, and transformation that our customers are seeing is related to their needs and how this technology helps make these goals achievable.</p>
			<p>We've seen over the past decade, and especially in the last year, that the ability to be agile and adapting as the world changes is a critical capability for all of us. Kubernetes enables this agility by introducing concepts such as containers and container images, as well as higher-level concepts such as services and deployments, which naturally push us toward architectures that are decoupled <em class="italics">microservices</em>. Although, of course, you can build microservice applications without Kubernetes, the natural tendency of the APIs and design patterns is to push you toward these architectures. Microservices are the <em class="italics">gravity well</em> of Kubernetes, so to speak. However, it's important to note that microservices are not the only way to run applications on Kubernetes. Many of our customers find great benefits in bringing their legacy applications to Kubernetes and mixing the management of existing applications with the development of new cloud-native implementations.</p>
			<p>As more and more people have started to conduct more and more of their lives online, the criticality of all of the services we have built has radically changed. It's no longer acceptable to have <em class="italics">maintenance hours</em> or <em class="italics">scheduled downtime</em>. We live in a 24x7 world where applications need to available at all times, even as we build, change, and rearrange them. Here, too, Kubernetes and Azure provide the tools that you need to build reliable applications. Kubernetes has health checks that automatically restart your application if it crashes, infrastructure for zero-downtime rollouts, and autoscaling technology that enables you to automatically grow to sustain a customer's load. On top of these capabilities, Azure provides the infrastructure to perform upgrades to Kubernetes itself without affecting applications running in the cluster, and autoscaling of the cluster itself to provide additional capacity to meet the demands of growing applications and the elasticity to right-size your cluster to the most efficient shape possible.</p>
			<p>In addition to these core capabilities, using AKS provides access to broader cloud-native ecosystems. There are countless engineers and projects in the <strong class="bold">Cloud Native Compute Foundation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNCF</strong>) ecosystem that can help you build your applications more quickly and reliably. As a leader and a contributor to many of these projects, Azure provides integration and supports access to some of the best open-source software that the world has to offer, including Helm, Gatekeeper, Flux, and more.</p>
			<p>But the truth is that building any application on Kubernetes involves much more than just the Kubernetes bits. Microsoft has a unique set of tools that integrate with AKS to provide a seamless, end-to-end experience. Starting with GitHub, where the world comes togeher to develop and collaborate, through to Visual Studio Code, where people build the software itself, and to tools such as Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to keep your applications healthy and secure, it is truly the combined capabilities of Azure that makes AKS a fantastic place for your applications to thrive. When you combine that with Azure's cloud-leading footprint around the world, which delivers more managed Kubernetes deployments in more locations than anyone else, you can see that AKS enables businesses to rapidly scale and grow to meet their needs from the initial startup phase through to the global enterprise level.</p>
			<p>Thank you for choosing Azure and Kubernetes! I'm excited that you're here and I hope you enjoy learning about everything Kubernetes and Azure has to offer.</p>
