  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A burgeoning startup in the fintech sector sought to carve out its niche by
    offering cutting-edge payment processing services. In its quest to ensure high
    availability and fault tolerance, the startup aggressively over-provisioned resources
    within its Kubernetes clusters. This approach led to a significant surge in operational
    costs, which began to erode the company’s capital reserves and impede its ability
    to invest in other critical areas, such as research and development and customer
    acquisition.

    startup found that its static resource allocation strategy was neither sustainable
    nor cost-effective. The Kubernetes cluster was often idle during off-peak hours,
    but the resources were still reserved and accruing expenses. Moreover, during
    unexpected spikes in demand, the manual scaling processes were too slow, resulting
    in performance bottlenecks that affected end user experience.

    while robust, was not optimized. It was evident that to maintain its competitive
    edge and financial health, the startup needed to address the anti-pattern of over-provisioning
    resources. The challenge was to implement a resource allocation strategy that
    could dynamically adapt to fluctuating workloads, optimize costs, and maintain
    the highest service levels required by financial service standards.
