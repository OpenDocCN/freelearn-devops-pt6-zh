- en: With more than 20 releases to date, Kubernetes is as hot as ever, even several
    years after its initial appearance in 2014\. Kubernetes, along with other cloud-native
    technologies, is massively reshaping the IT landscapes in some of the most advanced
    and progressive companies around the world.

- en: According to the **10th annual Open Source Jobs Report** by the **Linux Foundation**,
    cloud and containers are highlighted as the most demanded skills categories. Hence,
    having a strong command of Kubernetes and cloud-native skills is essential for
    advancing your career and working at some of the best organizations today. Becoming
    a certified Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate helps you to stand out and prove
    your competence in the field.

- en: This book will take you on a cloud-native journey from the very beginning and
    will teach you both the theoretical and practical aspects of Kubernetes. You’ll
    learn how to build, configure, and run containers with Docker; how to bootstrap
    minimal Kubernetes clusters; how to deploy, configure, and manage containerized
    applications with Kubernetes; how to automate software delivery with CI/CD, and
    much more. You’ll build a solid foundation to pass the KCNA exam on the first
    attempt and get a well-rounded view of today’s industry standards.

- en: A certified KCNA will confirm conceptual knowledge of the entire cloud native
    ecosystem, particularly focusing on Kubernetes. KCNA will demonstrate the candidate’s
    basic knowledge of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies, including how to
    deploy an application using basic **kubectl** commands, the architecture of Kubernetes,
    understanding the cloud native landscape and projects, and understanding the basics
    of cloud-native security.

    engineer, regardless of experience, anyone interested in learning about Kubernetes
    and cloud-native technologies will find this book practical and easy to follow.
    Familiarity with IT fundamentals (Git), operating systems, and command-line interfaces
    is required, but no prior knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, or cloud-native technologies
    is needed to get started.
