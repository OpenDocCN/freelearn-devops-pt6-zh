			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Hello and welcome! <em class="italic">Observability with Grafana</em> is a book about the tools offered by Grafana Labs for observability and monitoring. Grafana Labs is an industry-leading provider of open source tools to collect, store, and visualize data collected from IT systems. This book is primarily aimed toward IT engineers who will interact with these systems, whatever discipline they <span class="No-Break">work in.</span></p>
			<p>We have written this book as we have seen some common problems <span class="No-Break">across organizations:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Systems that were designed without a strategy for scaling are being pushed to handle additional data load or teams using the system</li>
				<li>Operational costs are not being attributable correctly in the organization, leading to poor cost analysis and management</li>
				<li>Incident management processes that treat the humans involved as robots without sleep schedules or parasympathetic nervous systems</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this book, we will use the OpenTelemetry Demo application to simulate a real-world environment and send the collected data to a free Grafana Cloud account that we will create. This will guide you through the Grafana tools for collecting telemetry and also give you hands-on experience using the administration and support tools offered by Grafana. This approach will teach you how to run the Grafana tools in a way so that anyone can experiment and <span class="No-Break">learn independently.</span></p>
			<p>This is an exciting time for Grafana, identified as a visionary in the <em class="italic">2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability</em> (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4500499">https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4500499</a>). They recently delivered change in two <span class="No-Break">trending areas:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost reduction</strong>: This has seen Grafana as the first vendor in the observability space to release tools that not only help you understand your costs but also reduce them.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>): Grafana has introduced generative AI tools that assist daily operations in simple yet effective ways – for example, writing an incident summary automatically. Grafana Labs also recently purchased <em class="italic">Asserts.ai</em> to simplify root cause analysis and accelerate problem detection.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We hope you enjoy learning some new things with us and have fun <span class="No-Break">doing it!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>IT engineers, support teams, and leaders can gain practical insights into bringing the huge power of an observability platform to their organization. The book will focus on engineers in disciplines such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Software development</strong>: Learn how to quickly instrument applications and produce great visualizations enabling applications to be easily supported</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operational teams</strong> (DevOps, Operations, Site Reliability, Platform, or Infrastructure): Learn to manage an observability platform or other key infrastructure platform and how to manage such platforms in the same way as any other application</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support teams</strong>: Learn how to work closely with development and operational teams to have great visualizations and alerting in place to quickly respond to customers’ needs and IT incidents</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This book will also clearly establish the role of leadership in incident management, cost management, and establishing an accurate data model for this <span class="No-Break">powerful dataset.</span></p>
