			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><st c="1389">Architecting on AWS</st></h1>
			<p><st c="1409">Architecting on AWS refers</st><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><st c="1436"> to the process of designing and planning cloud-based solutions using AWS. </st><st c="1511">It involves understanding the various AWS services, their capabilities, and how they can be combined to build scalable, secure, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1643">cost-effective architectures.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="1672">When architecting on AWS, the following four aspects should be considered, each detailed later in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="1771">this chapter:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="1784">Requirements gathering</st></strong><st c="1807">: This is a crucial step in the process of architecting solutions on AWS. </st><st c="1882">It involves understanding the business needs, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and constraints that will shape the design and implementation of the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2051">AWS architecture.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2068">Architecture patterns</st></strong><st c="2090">: AWS provides various architecture patterns and reference architectures that serve as starting points for common use cases, such as web applications, data processing pipelines, or serverless architectures. </st><st c="2298">You can leverage these patterns and customize them to meet their </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2363">specific requirements.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2385">Service selection</st></strong><st c="2403">: AWS offers a broad range of services, including compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and more. </st><st c="2534">You must carefully evaluate the requirements of the applications and select the appropriate AWS services that best fit </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2653">those needs.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="2665">Diagramming</st></strong><st c="2677">: Creating visual representations of the proposed architecture is a crucial step in the architecting process. </st><st c="2788">There are no AWS official tools, but </st><strong class="bold"><st c="2825">draw.io</st></strong><st c="2832"> or simply Microsoft PowerPoint can be used to create architecture diagrams, which</st><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><st c="2914"> helps communicate the design and facilitate collaboration </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="2973">and implementation.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="2992">Letâ€™s look at these aspects </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3021">in detail.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><st c="3031">Requirements gathering</st></h2>
			<p><st c="3054">Clear and well-defined </st><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><st c="3078">requirements are crucial for architects to design AWS solutions that meet the specific needs of the organization and provide the desired outcomes. </st><st c="3225">Gathering requirements can involve collaborating with stakeholders, conducting workshops, analyzing existing systems and data, and understanding the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3374">business context.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="3391">However, if your project has a smaller scope, not all these steps may apply. </st><st c="3469">Nonetheless, it is important to understand what type of requirements can be gathered before a </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3563">project starts:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3578">Business requirements</st></strong><st c="3600">: The first step is to understand the business objectives, goals, and drivers behind the solution being architected. </st><st c="3718">This includes factors such as the target market, expected growth, revenue models, and any specific business constraints or regulations that need to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="3866">be considered.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="3880">Functional requirements</st></strong><st c="3904">: These requirements define the specific features, functionalities, and capabilities that the solution must provide. </st><st c="4022">This could include requirements related to user interfaces, data processing, integration with existing systems, or specific </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4146">business logic.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4161">Non-functional requirements</st></strong><st c="4189">: Non-functional requirements define the qualitative attributes that the solution must possess, such as performance, scalability, availability, security, and compliance. </st><st c="4360">These requirements are often critical in determining the appropriate AWS services and architectural patterns to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4472">be used.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4480">Technical requirements</st></strong><st c="4503">: Technical requirements encompass the specific technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and tools that need to be used or integrated with the AWS solution. </st><st c="4669">This could include requirements for specific databases, messaging systems, or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="4747">third-party services.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="4768">Data requirements</st></strong><st c="4786">: Understanding the data requirements is essential when architecting on AWS. </st><st c="4864">This includes the types of data (structured, unstructured, or semi-structured), data volumes, data sources, data processing needs, and any specific data governance or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5031">compliance requirements.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5055">Integration requirements</st></strong><st c="5080">: If the AWS solution needs to integrate with existing on-premises systems, third-party services, or other cloud environments, the integration requirements must be clearly defined. </st><st c="5262">This includes identifying the integration points, data formats, protocols, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5341">security considerations.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5365">Security and compliance requirements</st></strong><st c="5402">: Depending on the industry and the nature of the data being handled, there may be specific security and compliance requirements that need to be addressed in the AWS architecture. </st><st c="5583">These could include regulatory standards, data protection laws, or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5650">industry-specific certifications.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="5683">Financial requirements</st></strong><st c="5706">: AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model. </st><st c="5751">Understanding the budget constraints and cost requirements is essential for selecting the appropriate AWS services and implementing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="5883">cost-effective architectures.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="5912">Bear in mind that some folks consider costs or security requirements part of the umbrella of functional and non-functional requirements. </st><st c="6050">Donâ€™t be pedantic about naming; just gather all </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6098">your requirements.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><st c="6116">Choosing an architecture pattern</st></h2>
			<p><st c="6149">Architecture patterns</st><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><st c="6171"> and reference architectures serve as starting points for designing and implementing cloud-based solutions. </st><st c="6279">These patterns encapsulate best practices, proven designs, and architectural principles tailored to specific use cases and requirements. </st><st c="6416">You can find many of these in</st><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><st c="6445"> the AWS Architecture </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6467">Center: </st></span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture"><span class="No-Break"><st c="6475">https://aws.amazon.com/architecture</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="6510">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6511">By leveraging AWS architecture patterns and reference architectures, you can build upon proven designs, accelerate the development process, and ensure that your solutions align with AWS best practices and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="6717">industry standards.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="6736">Architecture patterns address common scenarios and requirements. </st><st c="6802">These include patterns for web applications, data processing pipelines, serverless architectures, microservices, event-driven architectures, and more. </st><st c="6953">You can leverage these patterns as a foundation and customize them to meet </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7028">specific needs.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7043">In addition to general patterns, AWS provides reference architectures for specific domains and industries, such as e-commerce, media and entertainment, healthcare, financial services, and more. </st><st c="7238">These reference architectures offer detailed guidance on how to design and implement solutions using AWS services and best practices specific to </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7383">those domains.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7397">To select a pattern or architecture, you must carefully evaluate the requirements, constraints, and use cases of their solutions to select the most appropriate one. </st><st c="7563">This selection process involves understanding the strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs of each pattern, as well as their alignment with the rest of the technical stack. </st><st c="7733">This is often detailed in </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="7759">their description.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="7777">While architecture patterns provide a solid starting point, they are rarely implemented as-is. </st><st c="7873">You must customize and adapt the patterns to fit your specific requirements, integrating additional AWS services, adjusting configurations, and incorporating security, monitoring, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8057">operational considerations.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8084">It can also happen that what you need is a hybrid or multi-pattern architecture. </st><st c="8166">Some solutions require a combination of multiple architecture patterns or a hybrid approach that combines components of different patterns. </st><st c="8306">There is an extra challenge in determining how to </st><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><st c="8356">effectively integrate and orchestrate the different patterns into a cohesive and scalable architecture. </st><st c="8460">This is an advanced topic, which you will learn more about in later chapters of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8540">this book.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><st c="8550">Selecting a service</st></h2>
			<p><st c="8570">By now, you have a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><st c="8589"> well-defined problem and a generic architectural pattern. </st><st c="8648">The next step is service selection. </st><st c="8684">This is a critical aspect of architecting solutions in AWS. </st><st c="8744">With over 200 services available, AWS provides a vast array of building blocks that can be combined to create scalable, secure, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="8876">cost-effective architectures.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="8905">Service selection is an iterative process that involves balancing architectural best practices and all kinds of requirements: non-functional, functional, cost, security, and so on. </st><st c="9087">You must continuously evaluate and refine service selections as the solution evolves and new requirements or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9196">constraints emerge.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9215">The first step in service selection is to map the gathered requirements to the available AWS services. </st><st c="9319">This involves understanding the capabilities and use cases of each service and identifying the ones that can address the specific functional, non-functional, and technical requirements of the solution. </st><st c="9521">To make this mapping, you will need to first understand what category of service you should look at. </st><st c="9622">Services are organized into different categories, such as compute, storage, databases, networking, security, analytics, and more. </st><st c="9752">You will see different services in each of these categories in the following chapters of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="9841">this book.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="9851">After you have identified the service category that maps to your requirements, you will need to evaluate the different service capabilities. </st><st c="9993">Each AWS service offers a unique set of capabilities and features. </st><st c="10060">For example, if the solution requires a highly available and scalable database, services such as Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora might be suitable choices. </st><st c="10212">This will become </st><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><st c="10229">clearer as you advance through the chapters of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10276">this book.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="10286">Some interesting non-functional capabilities that you should consider are </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10361">as follows:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10372">Service integrations</st></strong><st c="10393">: AWS services are designed to work together seamlessly. </st><st c="10451">You should consider the integration points between different services and ensure that the selected services can be integrated effectively to deliver the </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10604">desired functionality.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="10626">Managed versus self-managed services</st></strong><st c="10663">: AWS offers both managed services, where AWS handles the underlying infrastructure and maintenance, and self-managed services, where the customer has more control but also more responsibility. </st><st c="10858">You must evaluate the trade-offs between these service types based on factors such as operational overhead, cost, and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="10976">compliance requirements.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11000">Pricing and cost optimization</st></strong><st c="11030">: AWS services have different pricing models, and you must consider the cost implications of their service selections. </st><st c="11150">Cost optimization strategies, such as leveraging reserved instances, spot instances, or auto-scaling, should be evaluated and incorporated into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11294">the architecture.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="11311">Roadmap</st></strong><st c="11319">: AWS services are constantly evolving, with new features and services being released regularly. </st><st c="11417">You should consider the future roadmap of the services they select and ensure that the architecture can accommodate potential changes or new </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11558">service offerings.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading"><st c="11576">Important note</st></p>
			<p class="callout"><st c="11591">Did you know that not every AWS service is available in all regions? </st><st c="11661">Thatâ€™s right. </st><st c="11675">AWS services are not uniformly available across all AWS regions. </st><st c="11740">You must therefore also consider the regional availability of the services you plan </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="11824">to use.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="11831">Sometimes, you will not find a suitable AWS service for your requirements and that is okay. </st><st c="11924">This is where third-party services come in. </st><st c="11968">Donâ€™t be scared to leverage third-party tooling if it fits your </st><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><st c="12032">needs. </st><st c="12039">However, consider all the previously mentioned dimensions such as cost or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12113">service integrations.</st></span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><st c="12134">Diagramming</st></h2>
			<p><st c="12146">Visual representations </st><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><st c="12170">of the proposed architecture help communicate the design, facilitate collaboration among team members, and ensure a shared understanding of the solutionâ€™s components and their interactions. </st><st c="12360">It also provides a map of </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12386">the implementation.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="12405">There is no standard tool to diagram AWS solutions. </st><st c="12458">The most well-accepted tools are PowerPoint using AWS Architecture Icons (</st><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/"><st c="12532">https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/</st></a><st c="12575">) or draw.io (</st><a href="https://app.diagrams.net"><st c="12590">https://app.diagrams.net</st></a><st c="12615">). </st><st c="12619">These tools include icons and shapes that represent the different </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="12685">AWS services.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="27537">The AWS SDKs are a</st><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><st c="27556"> collection of open-source libraries that provide programmatic access to AWS services from various programming languages including Java, Python, Node.js, .NET, Ruby, Go, PHP, and others. </st><st c="27743">These SDKs allow developers to build applications that interact with AWS resources and services directly, without the need for low-level AWS </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="27884">service APIs.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="27897">The AWS SDKs abstract away the complexities of making authenticated HTTP/HTTPS requests to AWS services, handling retries and error handling, and parsing the responses from AWS services. </st><st c="28085">They provide a higher-level, language-specific interface that makes it easier for developers to integrate AWS services into </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28209">their applications.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="28228">This are considered an advanced concept and you wonâ€™t see much of it in this book. </st><st c="28312">It is more often used by application developers. </st><st c="28361">If you are interested in understanding the syntax to create an EC2 instance using the SDK for Python, itâ€™s available under the </st><em class="italic"><st c="28488">Learn the basics</st></em><st c="28504"> section </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28513">at </st></span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_ec2_code_examples.html"><span class="No-Break"><st c="28516">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-library/latest/ug/python_3_ec2_code_examples.html</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="28598">.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="28599">From manual actions using the console to semi-automated ones such as the AWS CLI, youâ€™ve not yet </st><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><st c="28697">witnessed the full potential of automation. </st><st c="28741">In the next section, you will learn how to scale your deployments </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="28807">with IaC.</st></span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/><st c="28816">Understanding IaC</st></h1>
			<p><st c="28834">IaC is an approach </st><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><st c="28854">to provision and manage resources such as cloud infrastructure. </st><st c="28918">It allows you to define and deploy your resources using human-readable definition files </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29006">or code.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="29014">Instead of manually configuring resources through the AWS Console or CLI tools as you saw in previous sections, IaC allows a declarative specification of the desired infrastructure state. </st><st c="29203">In our context, thatâ€™s the AWS cloud. </st><st c="29241">This means compute instances, storage, networking, security groups, and other </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29319">AWS services.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="29332">By treating your IaC, you will get </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29368">multiple benefits:</st></span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="29386">Configuration consistency</st></strong><st c="29412">: IaC </st><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><st c="29419">promotes the concept of immutable infrastructure, whereby infrastructure components are treated as disposable and replaceable rather than being manually modified. </st><st c="29582">This approach ensures consistency, reduces configuration drift, and simplifies the process of scaling or </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="29687">updating infrastructure.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="29711">Version control and collaboration</st></strong><st c="29745">: IaC templates and code can be stored in version control systems such as Git, enabling collaboration, code reviews, and tracking of changes to the infrastructure definitions. </st><st c="29922">This promotes best practices in infrastructure management and facilitates knowledge sharing </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30014">among teams.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="30026">Automated deployments</st></strong><st c="30048">: IaC templates and code can be integrated with </st><strong class="bold"><st c="30097">Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</st></strong><st c="30145"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="30147">CI/CD</st></strong><st c="30152">) pipelines, enabling </st><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><st c="30175">automated deployments and updates. </st><st c="30210">This reduces manual effort, minimizes human errors, and ensures consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments (e.g., development, staging, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30371">and production).</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="30387">Infrastructure testing and validation</st></strong><st c="30425">: IaC templates and code can be tested and validated before deployment, ensuring that the defined infrastructure meets the desired specifications and adheres to organizational policies and </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30615">best practices.</st></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold"><st c="30630">Cost optimization and resource management</st></strong><st c="30672">: By treating infrastructure as code, organizations can more easily track and manage their AWS resources, enabling better cost optimization and resource utilization strategies. </st><st c="30850">You will no longer forget </st><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><st c="30876">that one virtual machine </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="30901">running somewhere.</st></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><st c="30919">There are multiple IaC tools. </st><st c="30950">AWS provides its own native IaC tools such as AWS CloudFormation, which allows users to define their infrastructure resources using JSON or YAML templates. </st><st c="31106">It also provides the </st><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><st c="31127">AWS </st><strong class="bold"><st c="31131">Cloud Development Kit</st></strong><st c="31152"> (</st><strong class="bold"><st c="31154">CDK</st></strong><st c="31157">). </st><st c="31161">This is not to be confused with AWS SDK, which offers a higher-level abstraction over CloudFormation, enabling developers to define AWS constructs using familiar programming languages such as TypeScript, Python, Java, </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31379">and C#.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31386">Beyond AWS-native tools, there are also plenty of third-party IaC solutions such as </st><strong class="bold"><st c="31471">Terraform</st></strong><st c="31480">. Terraform</st><a id="_idIndexMarker039"/><st c="31491"> is cloud-agnostic; it supports a wide range of cloud providers, including AWS, and provides a consistent workflow for managing infrastructure across multiple platforms. </st><st c="31661">It is one of the most well-known </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="31694">IaC tools.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="31704">Choosing an IaC tool </st><a id="_idIndexMarker040"/><st c="31726">boils down to personal preference, existing skills, and specific features each tool can offer. </st><st c="31821">In this book, you will get hands-on experience with CloudFormation and Terraform. </st><st c="31903">However, if you are interested in this topic, AWS offers prescriptive guidance on how to choose an IaC tool </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="32011">at </st></span><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/choose-iac-tool/introduction.html"><span class="No-Break"><st c="32014">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/choose-iac-tool/introduction.html</st></span></a><span class="No-Break"><st c="32104">.</st></span></p>

			<p><st c="37908">In this chapter, you learned what it means to architect on AWS. </st><st c="37973">Itâ€™s not only about deploying AWS services but also about gathering different types of requirements, contrasting those to known patterns and reference architectures, choosing different services, and documenting </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38184">it all.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="38191">You also explored the various methods and tools available for deploying and interacting with AWS services after you have your design. </st><st c="38326">The AWS Console provides a user-friendly graphical interface, while the AWS CLI and SDKs enable programmatic access and automation. </st><st c="38458">Additionally, you were exposed to various IaC techniques such as Terraform, CloudFormation, and AWS CDK, which allow you to define and manage your AWS infrastructure </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38624">using code.</st></span></p>
			<p><st c="38635">By understanding these different approaches, you can choose the most appropriate method based on your requirements and skill level, as well as the complexity of your AWS deployments. </st><st c="38819">Whether you prefer a visual interface, command-line tools, programmatic access, or IaC, AWS offers a range of options to meet your needs and streamline your </st><span class="No-Break"><st c="38976">cloud operations.</st></span></p>
