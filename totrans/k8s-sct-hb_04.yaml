    them are encryption at rest and encryption in transit. Previously, in [*Chapter
    3*](B20970_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor064), *Encrypting Secrets the Kubernetes-Native
    Way*, encryption at rest helped us increase our security at rest and in transit.
    In this chapter, we will focus on debugging issues that we might have with Secrets.
    Secrets play a critical role in storing and providing sensitive information used
    by applications and services running in a Kubernetes environment. They are crucial
    to our applications, and understanding how to effectively troubleshoot Secret-related
    issues can save lots of time and effort.

    makes it easy to introduce an error in the specification. By having the Secret
    defined through a YAML file, it is easy to check the structure through an editor
    and to ensure that we have the desired outcome. Also, a YAML file gives the flexibility
    to apply the same Secret multiple times. In case of an error, the same file can
    be fixed and applied.

    PGP uses public key encryption; a public and private key pair are used. The public
    key is used to encrypt the data and the private key to decrypt the data. The public
    key can be distributed, whereas the private key should be kept secret. Information
    can be encrypted by anyone who has access to the public key; however, the decryption
    can happen only through the actor holding the encryption key.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is essential to avoid leaking any Secrets when troubleshooting. When you
    have an issue with a Secret, it is very tempting to open a terminal session to
    a Kubernetes Pod and run troubleshooting commands. The logs generated in a container
    are written to the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) streams.
    Kubernetes is integrated with many popular logging solutions such as AWS CloudWatch,
    Datadog, and Google Cloud Monitoring. By printing Secrets on a Pod, those Secrets
    are written to those streams and will end up in one of the integrated logging
    solutions. A logging solution can be widely accessible in an organization – more
    accessible than direct Secret access on a Kubernetes cluster. The outcome of this
    action is a data leak, and as soon as this happens, the Secrets have to be revoked
    causing extra overhead.

    and focused on troubleshooting and debugging common issues faced with Secrets
    within our Kubernetes clusters. We learned how essential it is to keep Secrets
    organized and follow best practices, and how human error can introduce hours of
    troubleshooting. We also went through the process of identifying issues with Secrets
    and tools that we could use to get to the root of the problem. In the next chapter,
    we will focus on security and compliance when it comes to Kubernetes Secrets.
