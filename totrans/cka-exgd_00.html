<p>Kubernetes is by far the most popular container orchestration tool, yet the complexities of managing the tool have led to the rise of fully managed Kubernetes services over the past few years. The <strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes Administrator</strong> (<strong class="bold">CKA</strong>) certification is designed to ensure that certification candidates have the skills and knowledge to help them establish their credibility and value in the job market, to support business growth.</p>
<p>This book will start with an introduction to the Kubernetes architecture and the core concept of Kubernetes, and then we will take a deep dive into main Kubernetes primitives with hands-on scenarios for installation and configuration, cluster management and workload scheduling, networking, and security. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how to troubleshoot Kubernetes in our daily practice.</p>
<p>By the end of this book, you will be well versed in working with Kubernetes installation and configuration, and comfortable with the cluster management, storage, network, security-related configurations, and troubleshooting skills on vanilla Kubernetes.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is targeted toward application developers, DevOps engineers, data engineers, and cloud architects who want to pass the CKA exam to certify their Kubernetes Administrator skills in the market. A basic knowledge of Kubernetes is recommended.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B18201_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Kubernetes Overview</em>, introduces the Kubernetes architecture and its core concepts.

<p><a href="B18201_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor192"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Kubernetes</em>, covers how Kubernetes authentication and authorization pattern works, then dives into Kubernetes <strong class="bold">role-based access control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>). From there, we’ll put managing the security of applications deployed on Kubernetes into perspective. This part is less than 5% of the CKA exam content.</p>
<p><a href="B18201_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor235"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Demystifying Kubernetes Networking</em>, describes using the Kubernetes networking model and core concepts, as well as how to configure Kubernetes networking on the cluster nodes and network policies, configuring Ingress controllers and Ingress resources, configuring and leveraging CoreDNS, as well as how to choose an appropriate container network interface plugin.

<p><a href="B18201_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor293"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring and Logging Kubernetes Clusters and Applications</em>, describes how to monitor Kubernetes cluster components and applications, and how to get infrastructure-level, system-level, and application-level logs to serve as a source of log analytics or for further troubleshooting. Together with the next two chapters about troubleshooting cluster components and applications and troubleshooting Kubernetes security and networking, it covers 30% of the CKA exam content.</p>
<p><a href="B18201_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor340"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Troubleshooting Cluster Components and Applications</em>, describes the general troubleshooting approaches, and how to troubleshoot errors caused by cluster component failure and issues that occurred during the application deployments.</p>
<p><a href="B18201_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor366"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Troubleshooting Security and Networking</em>, follows on from <a href="B18201_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor340"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a> and provides the general troubleshooting approaches to troubleshoot errors caused by RBAC restrictions or networking settings. In <a href="B18201_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor192"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, we touched on how to enable Kubernetes RBAC and work with Kubernetes DNS. Be sure to go back and review those important concepts before diving into this chapter.</p>
