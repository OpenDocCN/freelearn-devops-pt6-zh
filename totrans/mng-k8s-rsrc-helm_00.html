			<p>Containerization is currently known to be one of the best ways to implement DevOps. While Docker introduced containers and changed the DevOps era, Google developed an extensive container orchestration system, Kubernetes, which is now considered the industry standard. With the help of this book, you’ll explore the efficiency of managing applications running on Kubernetes using Helm.</p>
			<p>Starting with a brief introduction to Helm and its impact on users working with containers and Kubernetes, you’ll delve into the primitives of Helm charts and its overall architecture and use cases. From there, you’ll learn how to write Helm charts in order to automate application deployment on Kubernetes and work your way toward more advanced strategies. These enterprise-ready patterns are focused on concepts beyond the basics so that you can get the most out of Helm, including topics related to automation, application development, delivery, life cycle management, and security.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have learned how to leverage Helm to build, deploy, and manage applications on Kubernetes.</p>
