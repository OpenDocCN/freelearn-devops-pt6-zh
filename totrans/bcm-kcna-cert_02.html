			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Overview of CNCF and Kubernetes Certifications</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>learn about <strong class="bold">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNCF</strong>) and its parent organization – the <strong class="bold">Linux Foundation</strong>. We will <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>learn what is behind those foundations, how they appeared, and which projects are curated in their ecosystems. We will also talk about the CNCF community, governance, cloud roles, and the Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">certification path.</span></p>
			<p>While this is one of the least technical chapters of this book, the content you’ll learn about makes up about half of the Cloud Native Architecture domain topics from the KCNA certification, so make sure that you answer all the recap questions at the end of <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>OSS and <span class="No-Break">open standards</span></li>
				<li>Linux <span class="No-Break">and CNCF</span></li>
				<li>CNCF community <span class="No-Break">and governance</span></li>
				<li>Cloud roles <span class="No-Break">and personas</span></li>
				<li>Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">certification path</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let’s get <span class="No-Break">to it!</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>OSS and open standards</h1>
			<p>If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>ever worked in any IT position, there is a high chance that you’ve come across the term <strong class="bold">open source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">OSS</strong>), know what it means, and very likely already <span class="No-Break">used some.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is OSS?</p>
			<p class="callout">OSS is when the source code of the software is publicly accessible and anyone can study, modify, and distribute it for any purpose. </p>
			<p>Software cannot be considered open source simply because it can easily be found on the internet or can be downloaded from the <em class="italic">darknet</em>. Software is open source when it is released under one of the open source licenses, such as Apache 2.0 or GNU General Public License v3. Those licenses grant users the right to make modifications to the source code or even use it for commercial purposes. That’s right – you can use OSS to build new software and sell it without paying any license fees to anyone. Alternatively, you can modify existing OSS, add new features, and sell it or offer related <span class="No-Break">support services.</span></p>
			<p>While the <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>history of OSS goes back to the early days of computing, it was at the beginning of the 90s when one of the most successful OSS was created. Yes, you’ve guessed it – we are talking <span class="No-Break">about Linux.</span></p>
			<p>The Linux kernel, which was started in 1991 by <em class="italic">Linus Torvalds</em>, is one of the most prominent examples of open source. For three decades, the project has attracted volunteer and enthusiast programmers willing to contribute for no compensation at all. At the time of writing, more than 15,000 people have contributed their time, skills, and effort to create a core operating system that powers 100% of the world’s supercomputers and about 95% of the <span class="No-Break">world’s servers.</span></p>
			<p>There are plenty of successful open source projects – Kubernetes, OpenStack, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, and Django are all open source. Even companies with huge engineering resources such as Google realize the power of open source communities and how much the open source ecosystem can boost a project. This is what happened <span class="No-Break">with Kubernetes.</span></p>
			<p>Kubernetes has attracted many passionate engineers since the early days and became the first project incubated at CNCF. But before we move on and learn more about CNCF, let’s touch on another important topic – <span class="No-Break">open standards.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Open standards</h2>
			<p>In 2015, along <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>with the establishment of CNCF, another important <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>event occurred – the <strong class="bold">Open Container Initiative</strong> (<strong class="bold">OCI</strong>) <span class="No-Break">was started.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">OCI</p>
			<p class="callout">OCI is an open governance structure whose purpose is to define open industry standards around container formats <span class="No-Break">and runtimes.</span></p>
			<p>OCI has a technical community within which industry participants may contribute to building container specifications that are vendor-neutral, portable, <span class="No-Break">and open.</span></p>
			<p>It also provides reference implementations and tools that deliver on the promise of containers for application portability. Those standards allow us to avoid vendor lock-ins (when a customer is forced to continue using a product or service because it is hard to switch to another vendor) and help ensure that different projects integrate and work well together. For example, as we learned in the previous chapter, container runtimes are not part of Kubernetes, so we need to make sure that different container runtimes and Kubernetes are <span class="No-Break">fully compatible.</span></p>
			<p>At the time of writing, OCI provides three important specifications for the <span class="No-Break">container ecosystem:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Image specification</strong> (image-spec) defines how to build and package an application <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>into an OCI-compliant <span class="No-Break">container image</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Runtime specification</strong> (runtime-spec) defines <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>the container life cycle and <span class="No-Break">execution environment</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distribution specification</strong> (distribution-spec) defines the protocol to facilitate <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>and standardize the distribution of container images using <span class="No-Break">so-called registries</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>So, why are the OCI <span class="No-Break">standards important?</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at a simple analogy regarding transportation. Imagine that each car manufacturer has a way of attaching the wheels to the axle. Wheel manufacturers would have a hard time creating rims for each make and model if they haven’t been standardized. But since everybody agreed to have certain wheel sizing parameters such as the width, diameter, number of bolt holes, and so on, it makes it possible for manufacturers to produce wheels that can fit any car model on the market. So, you can buy wheels based on your car’s specifications and be confident that they fit <span class="No-Break">your car.</span></p>
			<p>Similar to containers, we have image, runtime, and distribution standards that allow anyone to develop 100% compatible software. The establishment of OCI standards has allowed further expansion of the container ecosystem with the new software. Before the OCI, there was <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>only one way to build container images – using Docker. Today, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>projects <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>such as <strong class="bold">Kaniko</strong>, <strong class="bold">Podman</strong>, <strong class="bold">Buildah</strong>, <span class="No-Break">and others.</span></p>
			<p>You don’t need to know the exact differences at this point – just remember that OCI has marked an important point in the evolution of containers and the container ecosystem by providing <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>open specifications. In the upcoming chapters, we will dive into Docker and some aspects of the <span class="No-Break">OCI standards.</span></p>
			<p>According to OCI, it does not seek to be a marketing organization or define a full stack or solution requirements – it strives to avoid standardizing technical areas undergoing innovation and debate (<a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/main/CHARTER.md">https://github.com/opencontainers/tob/blob/main/CHARTER.md</a>). The organization that helped establish OCI and still plays a major role in its initiative is the Linux Foundation. Like with many open source projects, volunteers work in the field and would like to contribute their time to bring the technologies to the next level or bridge the gaps between <span class="No-Break">existing projects.</span></p>
			<p>We’ve already mentioned both CNCF and the Linux Foundation a few times here. Now, let’s get to know <span class="No-Break">them better.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Linux and CNCF</h1>
			<p>The Linux Foundation <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>is a non-profit organization that appeared in 2000 as a merger between Open-Source Development Labs and the Free Standards Group. Foundation was initially created to standardize, promote, and support the adoption of Linux, but it has significantly expanded its role in the open source community <span class="No-Break">since then.</span></p>
			<p>Today, the supporting members of the Linux Foundation include many of the Fortune500 companies such as Google, IBM, Samsung, Meta, and more. Foundation hosts <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>many projects <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>besides the Linux kernel. These <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>include <strong class="bold">Automotive Grade Linux</strong>, <strong class="bold">Ceph</strong> (storage), <strong class="bold">XEN</strong> (hypervisor), <strong class="bold">Real-Time Linux</strong>, the <strong class="bold">OpenAPI Initiative</strong> (<strong class="bold">OAI</strong>), and many others. Don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>worry if you <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>never heard of these projects before – you won’t be questioned about them during <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></p>
			<p>In recent years, the Linux Foundation has expanded its programs through conferences, certifications, training, and new initiatives. One such initiative is the <strong class="bold">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNCF</strong>), which was launched <span class="No-Break">in 2015.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>CNCF</h2>
			<p>July 21, 2015, became a remarkable date for the whole open source community – Kubernetes 1.0 was released. Along with its release, Google, as the key driving force and contributor <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>behind K8s, partnered with the Linux Foundation to form CNCF. Kubernetes became the seed technology and the first incubating project of the new foundation. CNCF’s mission was to advance container <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>and cloud-native technologies and align the <span class="No-Break">industry (</span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/about/who-we-are/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.cncf.io/about/who-we-are/</span></a><span class="No-Break">):</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“The Foundation’s mission is to make cloud-native computing ubiquitous.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive the adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.”</p>
			<p>We touched on the basics of cloud computing, containers, and microservices in <a href="B18970_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">From Cloud to Cloud Native and Kubernetes</em>, and will dive deeper into those and other topics mentioned in the CNCF mission statement in the <span class="No-Break">following chapters.</span></p>
			<p>Today, CNCF is supported by more than 450 members and plays a major role in the cloud-native ecosystem. It provides governance and supports open source projects to make them mature and ensure they’re in a <span class="No-Break">production-ready state.</span></p>
			<p>Speaking of maturity, there are three distinguished levels <span class="No-Break">in CNCF:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sandbox</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>the entry point for early-stage projects that can add value to the CNCF mission. New projects might be aligned with existing projects if they <span class="No-Break">complement them.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Incubating</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>is a project that is successfully used in production by the end users and has an ongoing flow of code commits and contributions, along with documentation, specifications, and a <span class="No-Break">versioning scheme.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Graduated</strong>: This is a project that has contributors from multiple organizations, maintains <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>Core Infrastructure Initiative best practices, and has passed an independent third-party security audit. The project should also define governance and committer processes, as well prove to be in use by <span class="No-Break">real users.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Every project hosted by CNCF has an associated maturity level. Projects increase their maturity levels by demonstrating that they received <em class="italic">end user adoption, a healthy rate of code changes, and committers from </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">different organizations</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>In addition, all CNCF projects must adhere to the <em class="italic">IP Policy</em> and adopt the <em class="italic">Code of Conduct</em>. The Code of Conduct defines what behavior is acceptable and what is not to create a positive and emphatical collaborative environment. On the other hand, the IP Policy is concerned with intellectual property and determines which open source license shall be applied (typically, this is Apache 2.0 for the source code and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International for documentation <span class="No-Break">and images).</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>CNCF community and governance</h1>
			<p>As open <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>source projects such as Kubernetes gain momentum, they attract more contributors, which is always a good sign. However, larger communities may get out of control and quickly become a <em class="italic">mess</em> without adequate governance. While CNCF does not require its hosted projects to follow any specific governance model, for a project to graduate, an explicit governance and committer process must be defined. CNCF follows the principle of <em class="italic">Minimal Viable Governance</em>, which means the projects are self-governing and the CNCF bodies will only step in if asked for help or if things are <span class="No-Break">going wrong.</span></p>
			<p>Speaking <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>about its structure, CNCF has three main bodies: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Governing Board</strong> (<strong class="bold">GB</strong>): Takes <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>care of marketing, budget, and other business decisions <span class="No-Break">for CNCF</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technical Oversight Committee</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOC</strong>): Responsible for defining and maintaining <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>the technical vision, approving new projects, and aligning existing ones based <span class="No-Break">on feedback</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">End User Community</strong> (<strong class="bold">EUC</strong>): Provides <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>feedback from end users and organizations to improve the overall experience in the <span class="No-Break">cloud-native ecosystem</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>TOC also determines if a project has reached another level of maturity. Projects can remain in an incubating stage indefinitely, but they are normally expected to graduate within <span class="No-Break">2 years.</span></p>
			<p>As you already know, Kubernetes was the first project to be incubated in CNCF and the first to reach <em class="italic">Graduated</em> status in 2018. That’s right – Kubernetes skipped the sandbox stage as it was first released at the same time CNCF was established. Since its inception, more than 10 other projects have graduated and about 100 projects are currently in the incubating or sandbox stage. In the next section, we’ll explore the roles and personas that are common in cloud <span class="No-Break">and cloud-native.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Cloud roles and personas</h1>
			<p>Cloud-native is not only about technologies and architectures, but also about people and efficient <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>collaboration in working environments. Therefore, it is common to have certain positions and roles in organizations working with cloud infrastructures and the cloud-native ecosystem. It is also a KCNA exam requirement to understand which roles we are talking about and which responsibilities <span class="No-Break">they assume.</span></p>
			<p>The following roles can be encountered in modern organizations that are adopting the cloud <span class="No-Break">and cloud-native:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud Architect or Cloud </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Solutions Architect</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DevOps Engineer</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">DevSecOps Engineer</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">FinOps Engineer</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site Reliability </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Engineer (SRE)</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Cloud Engineer</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Data Engineer</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Full </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Stack Developer</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This list is <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>not exhaustive, and you may sometimes see variations of these roles, but this should give you a general idea. Now, let’s make the differences between those roles and <span class="No-Break">responsibilities clear:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud (Solutions) Architect</strong>: It comes as no surprise that an architect is responsible <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>for designing the architecture of the cloud infrastructure <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>and cloud-native applications. It must be highly resilient, observable, scalable, and have a high degree <span class="No-Break">of automation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Cloud Architects are also often responsible for cloud strategy and selecting cloud providers (public, private, or hybrid) and suitable services (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS/serverless). Architect roles require broad knowledge from many <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>technical and non-technical <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>domains. For example, they must know the difference between <strong class="bold">capital expenditure or upfront costs</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAPEX</strong>) and <strong class="bold">operational expenditures or simply speaking running costs</strong> (<strong class="bold">OPEX</strong>). Traditional data centers are an example of high CAPEX, while the public cloud is an example of zero or almost zero CAPEX, with costs mostly being <span class="No-Break">operational (OPEX).</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevOps Engineer</strong>: <strong class="bold">Dev</strong> stands <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>for <strong class="bold">development</strong>, while <strong class="bold">Ops</strong> stands <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>for <strong class="bold">operations</strong>. A DevOps Engineer is somebody <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>who can do both by bridging the gaps between <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>developers and operationalists. Typically, a DevOps Engineer is somebody who has had previous experience as both a software developer and a system administrator or as an infrastructure engineer. This knowledge allows them to effectively automate infrastructure in the cloud and a whole application life cycle, including development, testing, and release. DevOps Engineers often need to know at least one programming language (for instance Python, Ruby, or Golang), as <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>well as several tools for automation (such as Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, and so on) and <strong class="bold">continuous integration and deployment/delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) systems. Nowadays, you’ll also often see Kubernetes experience as one of the requirements for DevOps roles. DevOps, as a culture, emphasizes learning over blame and promotes shared responsibility and strong cross-team collaboration, along with continuous <span class="No-Break">feedback loops.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">DevSecOps Engineer</strong>: This is very much like a DevOps Engineer, but with an extra <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>focus on security. With DevSecOps, security is introduced <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>at an early stage in application and infrastructure life cycles and requires tight collaboration with the <span class="No-Break">security team.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">FinOps Engineer</strong>: <strong class="bold">Fin</strong> stands <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>for <strong class="bold">financial</strong>, while <strong class="bold">Ops</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">operations</strong>. The FinOps engineer <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>enables teams to track <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>their budgets, provide transparency, and perform cost optimization in the cloud. This role requires a deep understanding of various pricing models and services in the cloud to find optimal and <span class="No-Break">cost-efficient solutions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site Reliability Engineer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRE</strong>): The responsibilities of the SRE include maintaining <a id="_idIndexMarker096"/>and optimizing cloud infrastructures <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>and applications. SRE is, in a way, similar to DevOps but focuses more <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>on the operational part and especially <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>on meeting application availability requirements or objectives defined in <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>) or <strong class="bold">service-level objectives</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLOs</strong>). SLA regulates the level of commitment between the service provider and clients regarding quality, availability, and responsibilities. SLOs are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA, such as availability or response time. SREs often participate in on-call rotation duties (that is, they are ready to react in case <span class="No-Break">of incidents).</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloud Engineer</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>another role that’s similar to DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>but focuses on the cloud specifics or service offerings of a cloud provider. Typically, the DevOps Engineer role requires a broader skill set, whereas a Cloud Engineer needs deeper knowledge about particular public <span class="No-Break">cloud services.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data Engineer</strong>: In this <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>role, an engineer must deal with data <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>protection, data storage, performance and availability requirements, and various tools for data classification, retention, and analysis. As enterprises accumulate more and more data, they need to make use of it. Therefore, Data Engineers are more in demand <span class="No-Break">these days.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Full Stack Developer</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>is a broad role in which <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>a developer needs to be able to take care of both the frontend, for example, the <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>backend parts of an application. The backend is a generic term that describes software implementation that’s not visible or accessible by end users. Sometimes, Full Stack developers can bring in some basic experience with cloud infrastructure and even <span class="No-Break">DevOps tools.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>While all <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>these roles and personas are in extremely high demand all over the world, it may not be easy to get an offer for one of those if you are coming from a completely different background or if you’ve just graduated university or college and have no relevant working experience. Accomplished certifications always make your profile stand out and give you higher chances of getting an interview in one of the desired roles. You’ll find a few pieces of career advice at the end of this book, but for now, let’s see which Kubernetes certifications are offered by CNCF and what the certification path <span class="No-Break">looks like.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Kubernetes certification path</h1>
			<p>At the <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>time of writing, CNCF offers four Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">certification exams:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kubernetes and Cloud Native </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Associate</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">KCNA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes Application </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Developer</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CKAD</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Administrator</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CKA</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Certified Kubernetes Security </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Specialist</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">CKS</strong></span><span class="No-Break">)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>CKA was <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>the first exam to be launched in 2017 and was valid for 2 years, but later, the validity period was extended to 3 years. CKAD <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>and KCNA also <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>have a 3-year validity period; only the CKS <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>exam is valid for 2 years <span class="No-Break">after passing.</span></p>
			<p>Out of all of the exams, CKS is the hardest and requires a candidate to hold a valid, non-expired CKA certification to demonstrate that they already possess sufficient K8s expertise. This means that while you can purchase CKS at any time, you won’t be able to take it unless you first pass CKA. All the other exams can be attempted in any order; however, the recommended path is shown in the <span class="No-Break">following diagram:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18970_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – CNCF Kubernetes certification path"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – CNCF Kubernetes certification path</p>
			<p>KCNA is the easiest exam on the list and the only one that is hands-off – that is, it contains multiple-choice questions. The other certifications are all hands-on and require you to complete activities on multiple K8s clusters in <span class="No-Break">a terminal.</span></p>
			<p>But don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>get your hopes up for a trivial KCNA exam. In fact, among entry-level certifications in the cloud field, it is a comparably hard certification. Even if you’ve worked in a relevant field for a few years, you are unlikely to pass it without any Kubernetes experience and some preparation. Make sure that you always answer all the recap questions and complete the mockup exam provided at the end of this book before attempting a <span class="No-Break">real exam.</span></p>
			<p>The following is some important information regarding the <span class="No-Break">KCNA exam:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>60 multiple <span class="No-Break">choice questions</span></li>
				<li>90 minutes to complete <span class="No-Break">the exam</span></li>
				<li>A score of 75% or above is needed <span class="No-Break">to pass</span></li>
				<li>The exam is scored automatically in around <span class="No-Break">24 hours</span></li>
				<li>Can be taken online from anywhere (webcam and <span class="No-Break">microphone required)</span></li>
				<li>One free retake is included in <span class="No-Break">the price</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>domains are tested in the <span class="No-Break">KCNA exam:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">Fundamentals (46%)</span></li>
				<li>Container <span class="No-Break">Orchestration (22%)</span></li>
				<li>Cloud-Native <span class="No-Break">Architecture (16%)</span></li>
				<li>Cloud-Native <span class="No-Break">Observability (8%)</span></li>
				<li>Cloud-Native Application <span class="No-Break">Delivery (8%)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you can see, Kubernetes makes up a major part of the exam. Therefore, the biggest part of this book (<em class="italic">Part 3,</em> <em class="italic">Learn Kubernetes Fundamentals</em>) is dedicated to K8s. Apart from that, the KCNA candidate should be able to confirm their conceptual knowledge of cloud-native and its landscape, projects, and practices. This includes high-level definitions from the previous chapter which might be questioned <span class="No-Break">in KCNA.</span></p>
			<p>The other three exams focus on different aspects of working with Kubernetes. The CKAD exam tests application deployment and management aspects, whereas CKA is more about setting up and managing Kubernetes itself. Nevertheless, these exams test many common domains and if you’ve passed one of those two, with a bit of extra preparation, you’ll pass the other one as well. Finally, CKS focuses on security and requires significant experience working <span class="No-Break">with Kubernetes.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ve learned about OSS and the importance of open standards in terms of OCI. OCI defines <strong class="bold">image</strong>, <strong class="bold">runtime</strong>, and <strong class="bold">distribution</strong> specifications that allow anyone to develop fully compatible container software. For instance, Kubernetes does not include its own container runtime; instead, it implements support for standardized runtime interfaces, allowing it to work with many container runtimes. Open, defined standards have paved the way for many new projects in the cloud-native ecosystem <span class="No-Break">and CNCF.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we covered the history behind CNCF and the Linux Foundation. CNCF was founded at the same time that the first version of Kubernetes was released and it became the first incubated project. CNCF distinguishes three levels of project maturity: <strong class="bold">Sandbox</strong>, <strong class="bold">Incubating</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Graduated</strong>. </p>
			<p>CNCF has three major bodies: <strong class="bold">Governing Board</strong> (<strong class="bold">GB</strong>), <strong class="bold">Technical Oversight Committee</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOC</strong>), and <strong class="bold">End User Community</strong> (<strong class="bold">EUC</strong>). TOC makes decisions about the maturity of CNCF projects. One of the requirements for a project to reach graduation is that it must have governance and committer processes defined. </p>
			<p>Cloud-native needs the right people to do the job and this is supported by a range of roles and personas you can find today in high demand on the market. We’ve looked at and compared the different roles to understand how the Cloud Architect’s responsibilities are different from those of a DevOps Engineer or a Full <span class="No-Break">Stack developer.</span></p>
			<p>Finally, we looked at the Kubernetes certification path and looked closer at the KCNA exam that you are preparing for. Make sure that you answer all the recap questions before moving on to the next chapter, where we will look at Docker and <span class="No-Break">run containers.</span></p>
