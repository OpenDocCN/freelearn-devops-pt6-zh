<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Essentials of IoT and Edge Computing</h1>
<p>Data volumes continue to grow, particularly in industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, energy, and transportation that are undergoing rapid digital transformation. This data explosion at the edge must be managed. There are numerous challenges involved with this, including system complexity, data privacy, latency issues, poor bandwidth connectivity, and rising costs for storing and processing data.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Edge computing</strong> reduces the amount<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> of long-distance connectivity between a device and server by getting compute as close to the data source as possible, thereby improving the way the data is handled, processed, and delivered. When it comes to large industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, energy, or transportation, industrial edge computing is being deployed to analyze and manage all data at the asset end in real time for real-time analytics or to use the aggregated data for further processing in the cloud.</p>
<p>The edge has three main<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> components, as outlined here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Connectivity</strong>: The ability to connect to any industrial system and collect and normalize data for immediate use</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Intelligence</strong>: Focusing on data processing and analytics functions at the edge to act and derive insights at the data source</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Orchestration</strong>: The ability to create, deploy, manage, and update edge applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Edge computing allows businesses to operate closer to the origin of the data more efficiently and with reduced latency. For rapid business decisions that improve quality and processes, the edge unlocks real-time analytics such as inventory usage, asset uptime and downtime, capacity utilization, and more.</p>
<p>The edge enables predictive/prescriptive maintenance, condition-based monitoring, overall equipment effectiveness, vision systems, quality improvements, and more. Edge data can also enable<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> more advanced use cases such as <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>). The intelligent edge is driving<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> significant operations and process improvements.</p>
<p>Businesses have begun to adopt modern edge platforms to drive these initiatives with a unified solution that enables the three facets of the edge—edge computing, edge analytics, and edge intelligence. A recent report from <em class="italic">Gartner</em> states that deployed <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) endpoints in the manufacturing<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> and natural resource industries are expected to reach 1.9 billion units by 2028.</p>
<p>In this and the following chapter, we are going to look at how Kubernetes, the edge, and the cloud can collaborate to drive intelligent business decisions.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover the following main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is IoT?</li>
<li>What is edge computing?</li>
<li>How are IoT and the edge related?</li>
<li>Benefits of edge computing</li>
<li>What does it take to enable edge computing, edge analytics, and edge intelligence?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>What is IoT?</h1>
<p>According to <em class="italic">Gartner</em> (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/internet-of-things">https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/internet-of-things</a>), IoT is a network of physical objects that contain embedded technology<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment. In simple terms, IoT refers to the process of connecting all the world's devices to the internet.</p>
<p>IoT devices can range from everyday objects such as lightbulbs to healthcare assets such as medical gadgets, wearables, smart devices, and even traffic lights in smart cities.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of IoT use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Virtual reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">VR</strong>) and <strong class="bold">augmented reality</strong> (<strong class="bold">AR</strong>)</li>
<li>Smart cities</li>
<li>Industrial IoT</li>
<li>Self-driving cars</li>
<li>Smart thermostats</li>
<li>Smart homes</li>
<li>Smartwatches</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical IoT system sends, receives, and analyzes<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> data continuously in a feedback loop. Humans or AI and ML can do analysis in near real time or over a longer period of time. <em class="italic">Gartner</em> estimated that there would be 20 billion internet-connected objects by 2020. This is the case, even though these are not general-purpose gadgets, but rather products such as jet engines, connected cars, or even coffee machines.</p>
<p>Data is collected and processed using an IoT edge device. An IoT edge device has the storage and computational capability to make low-latency decisions and analyze data in milliseconds; however, not all edge devices are IoT devices. In the sections that follow, we'll go through all this in greater depth.</p>
<p>Businesses can employ IoT solutions to evaluate data generated by IoT edge devices and use this information to improve business decisions and develop new business applications. In the next section, we'll look at a typical IoT solution design that allows you to integrate and work together with data from a variety of systems, devices, apps, and human interactions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Key elements of an IoT solution</h2>
<p>There is a gap between IoT edge devices<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> and corporate applications due to a lack of interface and communication standards. An IoT platform acts as a middleware that connects the two endpoints, bridging the gap. Modern IoT platforms, on the other hand, go a step further than this by including functionality in both the hardware and application layers. As a result, the functionality set of an IoT platform may include capabilities for edge data processing or complex data analysis techniques.</p>
<p>Devices that are connected to the internet—such as smartphones, digital watches, and electrical appliances—begin the process by securely communicating with the IoT platform. The platforms collect<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> and analyze data from a variety of devices and then send the most valuable data to devices via applications.</p>
<p>IoT edge devices<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> that support important communication<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> technologies, including Wi-Fi, <strong class="bold">NarrowBand-IoT</strong> (<strong class="bold">NB-IoT</strong>), and Sigfox, as well as protocols such as <strong class="bold">Message Queuing Telemetry Transport</strong> (<strong class="bold">MQTT</strong>), <strong class="bold">Constrained Application Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">CoAP</strong>), and <strong class="bold">HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTPS</strong>), can connect directly<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> to the IoT platform. Because this isn't always<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> the case, an abstraction layer is required, which provides the technologies and procedures required to translate between multiple protocols and communication technologies, thereby mediating data flow.</p>
<p>A typical IoT platform's architecture is represented in the following diagram—it allows you to connect and collaborate with data from many systems, devices, apps, and human interactions:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer055">

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.1 – IoT platform architecture</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of each layer of the architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong class="bold">infrastructure</strong> layer contains<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> components that allow the platform to function as a whole. Here, you'll find various compute/storage/network solutions, container management options, data lakes, internal platform messaging, as well as monitoring and storage solutions.</li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">integration</strong> layer is primarily in charge<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> of receiving data from connected edge devices, analyzing it, distributing it to business applications, and managing devices.</li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">security</strong> layer oversees assuring<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> the data's validity, security, and privacy by enforcing data safeguard and authority principles, as well as implementing remedial controls and actions.</li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">application</strong> layer contains apps that use the<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> integration layer's fundamental IoT features to meet business objectives. This is where applications such as complex data analytics, condition monitoring, retrofitting/configuration, and predictive maintenance applications would be housed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we've looked at the basic architecture of an IoT platform, let's look at some of the challenges of IoT. In recent years, the volume of sensor-generated data from gadgets has exploded, and this trend is projected to continue. Because data loses its value quickly after creation, frequently in milliseconds, the speed with which businesses can turn data into insights and subsequently into action is considered mission-crucial. As a result, a company's agility can be enhanced by minimizing the time between data generation and decision or action as far as possible.</p>
<p>However, because data transmission speed is intrinsically limited by the speed of light, latency can only be reduced or eliminated totally by reducing the distance that data must travel. Because data travels hundreds or even thousands of miles in a cloud-only world, edge computing can be used in circumstances where latency is critical. Let's look at how edge computing addresses this issue in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>What is edge computing?</h1>
<p>Edge computing is a distributed computing<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> concept in which intelligence is built into edge devices, also known as edge nodes, allowing data to be processed and analyzed in real time close to the data collection point. When adopting edge computing, data does not need to be transferred to the cloud or to a centralized data processing system.</p>
<p>According to <em class="italic">Gartner</em>'s estimate, up to 55 percent of IoT data could be processed at the origin in the near future, either on the device itself or through edge computing. Indeed, scalability will likely play a key role in this change, as increased data demands will necessarily focus on latency, and lowering latency might significantly improve reaction time, saving time and money.</p>
<p>A typical edge computing architecture is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer056">
<img alt="Figure 3.2 – Edge computing architecture " height="804" src="image/Figure_3.2_B18115.jpg" width="1043"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.2 – Edge computing architecture</p>
<p>Because data is handled close to the data aggregation source, edge computing eliminates the need to move<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> data to the cloud or an on-premises data center for processing and analysis. Both the network and the servers are less stressed as a result of this strategy. Edge computing is ideal for IoT, particularly <strong class="bold">industrial IoT</strong> (<strong class="bold">IIoT</strong>), because of its ability to process<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> data in real time and its faster response time.</p>
<p>Edge computing technology provides far more breakthroughs, such as AI and ML, in addition to faster digital transformation for industrial and manufacturing organizations.</p>
<p>Let's look at some specific use cases of edge computing here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Visual inferencing</strong>: High-resolution cameras<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> are frequently installed on edge devices. They can consume video streams from these cameras and do ML on the information right on the edge machine. That inferencing<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> can just detect the persons in the view, or it can execute more complicated inferences. Additionally, some edge applications can detect whether someone is wearing a correctly fitted mask, has a high body temperature, or is keeping a suitable distance between them.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Anomaly detection</strong>: In many industrial plants and factories, edge devices play a significant role. They can see <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>and hear things that humans are unable to discern, and they can infer difficulties as well as (or sometimes even better than) the most expert human operators in a variety of situations. Edge computers, for example, can precisely monitor electric motor power use and respond quickly without the need for human participation. Edge computers can also listen for unusual sounds coming from sophisticated machinery and inform human operators if something is wrong.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Environment monitoring</strong>: Edge devices can detect dangerous conditions such as particulate pollution<a id="_idIndexMarker183"/> or poisonous gases and act quickly (within milliseconds) to remedy or minimize the situation while also contacting the proper authorities.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Multi-access edge computing</strong> (<strong class="bold">MEC</strong>): Since they are geographically near to users, computers in telecom MEC facilities<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> can provide services that were previously only available in huge<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> corporate data centers or public clouds, but with substantially lower latencies. Because the edge devices in these MECs are similar to the server class machines found in major data centers, they can handle any data center workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have seen some of the use cases of edge computing, let's look at how IoT and the edge are related in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>How are IoT and the edge related?</h1>
<p>IoT benefits from processing<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> power being closer to the physical device<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/> or data source. For data collected by IoT sensors and devices to be used to react faster or eliminate issues, it must be analyzed at the edge rather than traveling back to a central site.</p>
<p>By providing a local source of processing and storage for the data and computing demands of IoT devices, edge computing reduces communication latency between IoT devices and the central <strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) networks to which they are connected.</p>
<p>IoT would rely on cloud or data center connection and computation services without edge computing. Sending data back and forth between an IoT device and the cloud could slow response times and reduce operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Edge computing also addresses network capacity requirements for transferring large amounts of data across sluggish cellular or satellite connections, as well as the ability for systems to work offline if a network connection is lost.</p>
<p>The huge amounts of data created by linked IoT devices can be taken advantage of by using edge computing. Data may be processed locally and used to make quick decisions by deploying analytics algorithms and ML models to the edge. Data can also be aggregated locally before being sent to a central location for processing or long-term storage.</p>
<p>Under the cloud computing model, compute resources and services are usually centralized at large data centers. The clouds frequently provide the network infrastructure required to connect IoT devices to the internet. Edge devices require network access to provide back-and-forth communication between the device and a central database. The clouds are often used to provide network connectivity. The transmission of data from an edge device to a data center via the cloud, or an edge device transmitting a record of its decisions back to the data center for data storage, processing, or big data analysis, are examples of the cloud's communication capabilities.</p>
<p>Many IoT and edge use cases stem from the need to process data locally in real-time situations, where sending the data to a data center for processing would result in unacceptable delay. Here are some examples of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">IoT sensors create a continual stream of data on the manufacturing floor</em> that may be utilized to prevent breakdowns and optimize operations. A modern plant with 2,000 pieces of equipment can generate around 2,200 <strong class="bold">terabytes</strong> (<strong class="bold">TB</strong>) of data every month, according to one estimate. Instead of sending this wealth of data to a remote data center, it's faster and less expensive to process it closer to the<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> equipment. However, connecting the<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> equipment through a centralized data platform is still desirable. Equipment, for example, can receive standardized software upgrades and transmit filtered data that can aid in the improvement of operations in other plant locations.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Another common example of edge computing is connected automobiles</em>. Computers are installed on buses and railways to track passenger flow and service delivery. With the technology onboard their trucks, delivery drivers can determine the most effective routes. When employing an edge computing strategy, each vehicle runs on the same standardized platform as the rest of the fleet, improving service reliability and maintaining data security across the board.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Network functions virtualization</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFV</strong>), which uses virtual computers running on conventional hardware<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> at the network edge, is becoming increasingly popular among telecom operators. These <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>) can take the place <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>of costly proprietary hardware. With an edge computing strategy, suppliers can keep the software running reliably and with uniform security standards in tens of thousands of remote sites. In a mobile network, applications running close to the end user reduce latency and allow providers to offer new services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram depicts<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> how sensors and gadgets<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> on a factory floor interact <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>with the cloud and the edge:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 3.3 – Typical architecture of a manufacturing floor interacting with the IoT, edge, and cloud</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of each layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Device layer</strong>: This layer represents<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> bits and pieces of major equipment or the actual equipment itself and is tied to local operational technologies and IoT capabilities for rapid interactions. This layer uses cloud-trained ML models to perform ML scoring or inferencing. There's also a lot of raw device data stored here.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Edge connectivity and plant applications layers</strong>: While the plant applications layer<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> provides visibility and control of all bits and pieces of equipment or the equipment itself in a plant, the edge connection layer allows the equipment and plant applications to communicate with one another.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cloud-hosted enterprise layer</strong>: A portfolio view is provided by the cloud-hosted enterprise<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> layer, which primarily gives a view and control across multiple plants. Business analysis and ML algorithms are part of this layer to predict and provide actionable intelligence using trained ML models. These models could be retrained in this layer to use data from across all plants' equipment portfolios and are then sent back to the edge and eventually to the IoT software at each piece of equipment, making operations smarter with the data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Benefits of edge computing</h1>
<p>To summarize, data<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> can be analyzed, processed, and transported at the network's edge via edge computing. In other words, the data is analyzed in real time, close to where it is kept, with no latency. Data from IoT devices can be analyzed at the network's edge before being sent to a data center or cloud.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of edge computing are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>High speed, low latency, and great dependability, allowing for faster data processing and content delivery</li>
<li>Improved security by dispersing processing, storage, and applications across a diverse set of devices and data centers, making it more difficult for a single outage to bring the network down</li>
<li>Provides a much more cost-effective path to scalability and versatility, allowing businesses to enhance their computing capacity by combining IoT devices with edge data centers</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are many benefits to edge computing, it can also provide operational and architectural challenges. Edge processing, which is highly decentralized and generally comprises far-flung and/or difficult-to-access locations, includes sensors/actuators and gateways in offices, plants, campuses, on pipelines, and in other remote field sites. In any given organization, there are thousands of devices and hundreds of gateways. These edge nodes are equipped with firmware, operating systems, virtualization and containers, and applications, some of which are provided by manufacturers and others by solution providers. These edge nodes must be properly managed and maintained by their owner/manager, who necessitates a high level of automation (such as for backups, patching, updates, and monitoring).</p>
<p>Some operational and design challenges that need to be taken care of are outlined here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Updating of edge nodes</strong>: Edge processing<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/> involves the execution and replication of data center operations such as provisioning, updating, change management, and monitoring across all edge<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> nodes and clusters, as well as additional services, such as device management and updating ML models.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Policies and practices</strong>: Edge deployments, which are scattered over multiple sites and are significantly more dynamic<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> than traditional data centers, are typically unsuited for traditional data center regulations and processes. Taking on the operational administration of such a system is difficult.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cost</strong>: While the cloud offers on-demand<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> scalability and is simple to alter, automate, and maintain, implementing similar functionality at the edge can be costly and time-consuming. Extending an existing edge deployment to accommodate more devices and edge nodes can require a significant investment in more hardware and software, as well as a significant amount of time and work.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cybersecurity</strong>: When the cloud and data<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> center are extended to the perimeter with numerous nodes and devices, the surface area for cyberattacks increases considerably. Insecure endpoints, such as devices and edge nodes, can be used to gain access to a company's valuable<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> assets as well as for other purposes such as <strong class="bold">distributed denial-of-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDoS</strong>) assaults. It's a challenging and vital duty to keep all assets on the edge in a physically secure state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The edge is just a necessary <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>or mandatory feature of many IoT use cases if there is currently an operational technology. Adding a cloud-hosted component to an IoT system, even if it's simply a gateway, demands some kind of edge computing presence. The use of certain edge-processing capacity, for example, is required to add smart features to current system architecture and provide a cloud-based portfolio view. We'll look at what it takes to enable edge computing in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>What does it take to enable edge computing, edge analytics, and edge intelligence?</h1>
<p>To meet the needs of modern<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> manufacturing, automotive, or telecommunications <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>industries, it is important to acknowledge that businesses<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> are under tremendous pressure to drive innovation and efficiency on their plant floors. This necessitates a comprehensive methodology that combines new/existing IT products with emerging methodologies, along with the goal of avoiding the time-consuming and error-prone manual configuration of several devices and applications at scale.</p>
<p>The following considerations must be noted while building<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> an edge architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Autonomy and resiliency</strong>: Because the solution necessitates autonomy, connection interruptions cannot be permitted.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Resource constraints</strong>: Low compute capability and small footprint of the devices.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security challenges</strong>: Data privacy, physical device security, and network security of the connected devices.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Manageability</strong>: Manage application software across thousands of devices from many different suppliers.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reliability</strong>: Consistency in the building, deployment, and maintenance of applications.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: With high levels of automation, provision for automated mechanisms to deploy and maintain multiple distributed applications over any number of physical or virtual computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the difficulties of putting up an edge-based architecture, it is best to decide whether edge computing is necessary. A cloud-only solution may be the best option. The next step is to determine which capabilities are necessary at the edge, and then to choose the optimum deployment plan, given that edge processing can occur on devices, gateways, edge servers, possibly over multiple tiers, or in micro data centers.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In conclusion, IoT and the data it generates are transforming the world and how we interact with it. The cloud is at the heart of most of the connected-consumer IoT world, thanks to its numerous advantages. An IoT solution, on the other hand, will almost always involve both the edge and the cloud. Bringing computing to the edge helps organizations make better, faster decisions and become more agile by reducing latency, increasing scalability, and improving information access.</p>
<p>When deciding on the correct balance of edge and cloud capability for an IoT solution, it's important to remember that edge computing comes in a variety of flavors, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Significant operational difficulties and costs can arise quickly, so businesses should examine a wide range of issues when planning and implementing any IoT system.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at how Kubernetes for the edge offers a compelling value proposition and different architectural approaches that demonstrate how Kubernetes can be used for edge workloads, as well as support for the architecture that meets enterprise applications' requirements—low latency, resource-constrained, data privacy, bandwidth scalability, and so on.</p>
