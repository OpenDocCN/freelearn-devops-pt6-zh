    data loses its value quickly after creation, frequently in milliseconds, the speed
    with which businesses can turn data into insights and subsequently into action

    computing. Indeed, scalability will likely play a key role in this change, as
    increased data demands will necessarily focus on latency, and lowering latency
    might significantly improve reaction time, saving time and money.

    with numerous nodes and devices, the surface area for cyberattacks increases considerably.
    Insecure endpoints, such as devices and edge nodes, can be used to gain access
    to a company''s valuable assets as well as for other purposes such as **distributed
    denial-of-service** (**DDoS**) assaults. It''s a challenging and vital duty to
    keep all assets on the edge in a physically secure state.'

    is currently an operational technology. Adding a cloud-hosted component to an
    IoT system, even if it's simply a gateway, demands some kind of edge computing
    presence. The use of certain edge-processing capacity, for example, is required
    to add smart features to current system architecture and provide a cloud-based
    portfolio view. We'll look at what it takes to enable edge computing in the next
    section.

    industries, it is important to acknowledge that businesses are under tremendous
    pressure to drive innovation and efficiency on their plant floors. This necessitates
    a comprehensive methodology that combines new/existing IT products with emerging
    methodologies, along with the goal of avoiding the time-consuming and error-prone
    manual configuration of several devices and applications at scale.

    to decide whether edge computing is necessary. A cloud-only solution may be the
    best option. The next step is to determine which capabilities are necessary at
    the edge, and then to choose the optimum deployment plan, given that edge processing
    can occur on devices, gateways, edge servers, possibly over multiple tiers, or
    in micro data centers.

- en: In conclusion, IoT and the data it generates are transforming the world and
    how we interact with it. The cloud is at the heart of most of the connected-consumer
    IoT world, thanks to its numerous advantages. An IoT solution, on the other hand,
    will almost always involve both the edge and the cloud. Bringing computing to
    the edge helps organizations make better, faster decisions and become more agile
    by reducing latency, increasing scalability, and improving information access.

    solution, it's important to remember that edge computing comes in a variety of
    flavors, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Significant operational
    difficulties and costs can arise quickly, so businesses should examine a wide
    range of issues when planning and implementing any IoT system.

    value proposition and different architectural approaches that demonstrate how
    Kubernetes can be used for edge workloads, as well as support for the architecture
    that meets enterprise applications' requirements—low latency, resource-constrained,
    data privacy, bandwidth scalability, and so on.
