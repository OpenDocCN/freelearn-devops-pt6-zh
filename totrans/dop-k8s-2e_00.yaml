- en: This book explains fundamental concepts and useful skills for implementing DevOps
    principles with containers and Kubernetes. Our journey starts by introducing the
    core concepts of containers and Kubernetes, and we explore the various features
    provided by Kubernetes, such as persisting states and data for containers, different
    types of workloads, cluster network, and cluster management and extension. In
    order to supervise the cluster activity, we implement a monitoring and logging
    infrastructure in Kubernetes. For better availability and efficiency, we also
    learn how to autoscale containers and build a continuous delivery pipeline. Lastly,
    we learn how to operate the hosted Kubernetes platforms from the top three major
    public cloud providers.

    walks you through the evolution from the past to what we call DevOps today, and
    the tools that you should know in this field. Demand for people with DevOps skills
    has been growing rapidly over the last few years. DevOps practices have accelerated
    software development and delivery speed, as well as helping business agility.'

    helps you learn the fundamentals of working with containers. With the increasing
    trend toward microservices, containers are a handy and essential tool for every
    DevOps practitioner because of the agility they bring to managing heterogeneous
    services in an uniform way.'

    access control features of Kubernetes, and looks at the built-in admission controllers
    that provide finer granularity of control over your cluster. Furthermore, we'll
    also learn how to build our own custom resource to extend the cluster with customized
    features.

    explains how default networking and routing rules work in Kubernetes. We''ll also
    learn how to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes for external access. At the end of this
    chapter, the network policy and service mesh features are also introduced for
    better resiliency.'

    node levels using Prometheus. This chapter also shows how to collect logs from
    your applications, the service mesh, and Kubernetes with Elasticsearch, Fluent-bit/Fluentd,
    and the Kibana stack. Ensuring the service is up and healthy is one of the major
    responsibilities of DevOps.'
