			<h2 id="_idParaDest-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"/>Hands-on Kubernetes on Azure – Third Edition</h2>
			<p>Containers and Kubernetes containers facilitate cloud deployments and application development by enabling efficient versioning with improved security and portability.</p>
			<p>With updated chapters on role-based access control, pod identity, storing secrets, and network security in AKS, this third edition begins by introducing you to containers, Kubernetes, and <strong class="bold">Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">AKS</strong>), and guides you through deploying an AKS cluster in different ways. You will then delve into the specifics of Kubernetes by deploying a sample guestbook application on AKS and installing complex Kubernetes apps using Helm. With the help of real-world examples, you'll also get to grips with scaling your applications and clusters.</p>
			<p>As you advance, you'll learn how to overcome common challenges in AKS and secure your applications with HTTPS. You will also learn how to secure your clusters and applications in a dedicated section on security. In the final section, you'll learn about advanced integrations, which give you the ability to create Azure databases and run serverless functions on AKS as well as the ability to integrate AKS with a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. </p>
			<p>By the end of this Kubernetes book, you will be proficient in deploying containerized workloads on Microsoft Azure with minimal management overhead.</p>
