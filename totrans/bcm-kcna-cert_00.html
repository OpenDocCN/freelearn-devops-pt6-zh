			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>With more than 20 releases to date, Kubernetes is as hot as ever, even several years after its initial appearance in 2014. Kubernetes, along with other cloud-native technologies, is massively reshaping the IT landscapes in some of the most advanced and progressive companies around <span class="No-Break">the world.</span></p>
			<p>According to the <strong class="bold">10th annual Open Source Jobs Report</strong> by the <strong class="bold">Linux Foundation</strong>, cloud and containers are highlighted as the most demanded skills categories. Hence, having a strong command of Kubernetes and cloud-native skills is essential for advancing your career and working at some of the best organizations today. Becoming a certified Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate helps you to stand out and prove your competence in <span class="No-Break">the field.</span></p>
			<p>This book will take you on a cloud-native journey from the very beginning and will teach you both the theoretical and practical aspects of Kubernetes. You’ll learn how to build, configure, and run containers with Docker; how to bootstrap minimal Kubernetes clusters; how to deploy, configure, and manage containerized applications with Kubernetes; how to automate software delivery with CI/CD, and much more. You’ll build a solid foundation to pass the KCNA exam on the first attempt and get a well-rounded view of today’s <span class="No-Break">industry standards.</span></p>
			<p>The book is divided into <span class="No-Break">five parts:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li><em class="italic">The Cloud Era</em></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Performing Container Orchestration</em></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Learning Kubernetes Fundamentals</em></li>
				<li><em class="italic">Exploring Cloud Native</em></li>
				<li><em class="italic">KCNA Exam and Next Steps</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In the first part, you’ll be introduced to cloud native computing, explaining how the industry evolved and why modern applications often run in containers. Next, you’ll learn about Docker and get hands-on with running <span class="No-Break">containers locally.</span></p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Part 3</em>, the largest part, you’ll learn about Kubernetes: its features, architecture, API, and components. You’ll find the best practices, recap questions, and lots of practical assignments to support your journey. In <em class="italic">Part 4</em>, we’ll focus on cloud-native architectures and other technologies from the cloud-native ecosystem. We’ll see how to monitor, observe, and deliver cloud-native applications. Finally, in <em class="italic">Part 5</em>, you’ll find mock exams and tips on passing KCNA, as well as some advice on how to proceed after <span class="No-Break">becoming certified.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate</strong> (<strong class="bold">KCNA</strong>) is a pre-professional certification designed for candidates interested in advancing to the professional level through a demonstrated understanding of Kubernetes foundational knowledge <span class="No-Break">and skills.</span></p>
			<p>A certified KCNA will confirm conceptual knowledge of the entire cloud native ecosystem, particularly focusing on Kubernetes. KCNA will demonstrate the candidate’s basic knowledge of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies, including how to deploy an application using basic <strong class="bold">kubectl</strong> commands, the architecture of Kubernetes, understanding the cloud native landscape and projects, and understanding the basics of <span class="No-Break">cloud-native security.</span></p>
			<p>Whether a fresh IT graduate, a developer, a system administrator, or a DevOps engineer, regardless of experience, anyone interested in learning about Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies will find this book practical and easy to follow. Familiarity with IT fundamentals (Git), operating systems, and command-line interfaces is required, but no prior knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, or cloud-native technologies is needed to <span class="No-Break">get started.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18970_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">From Cloud to Cloud Native and Kubernetes</em>, shares how computing has evolved over the past 20+ years. It explains what the cloud is, how it appeared, and how IT landscapes have changed with the introduction of containers. You will learn about fundamentals such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS, as well as take a first look <span class="No-Break">at Kubernetes.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18970_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Overview of CNCF and Kubernetes Certifications</em>, introduces the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and its parent organization – the Linux Foundation. It will share what is behind those foundations, how they appeared, and which projects are curated in their ecosystems. This chapter will explain about the CNCF community, governance, cloud roles, and Kubernetes <span class="No-Break">certification path.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18970_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Containers</em>, provides a closer look at containers, diving deeper into container technology and container ecosystem, and discovering commonly used Docker tooling. This chapter includes <span class="No-Break">practical assignments.</span></p>
			<p><a href="B18970_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Container Runtimes, Interfaces, and Service Meshes</em>, takes you further to explore container runtimes, networking, and interfaces, and learn about service meshes. You will learn how containers can communicate with each other over the network, which container interfaces exist in Kubernetes, and get to know what a service mesh is and <span class="No-Break">its applications.</span></p>
