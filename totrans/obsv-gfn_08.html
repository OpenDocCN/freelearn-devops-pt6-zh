			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Displaying Data with Dashboards</h1>
			<p>Now that we have explored the topics covered in the earlier chapters together, we have a good understanding of the many ways<a id="_idIndexMarker689"/> to retrieve accessible data from Grafana. We will now create our first <strong class="bold">dashboard</strong> together and look at different ways to visualize our data. We will then explore concepts and techniques that help you communicate effectively with your dashboards and reduce cognitive load for your viewers. We will look at a few resources for inspiration out in the community to inspire you with your dashboards. Then, to finish, we will share guidance around managing your dashboard artifacts as they grow to help you <span class="No-Break">get organized.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following <span class="No-Break">main topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating your <span class="No-Break">first dashboard</span></li>
				<li>Developing your <span class="No-Break">dashboard further</span></li>
				<li>Using visualizations <span class="No-Break">in Grafana</span></li>
				<li>Developing a <span class="No-Break">dashboard purpose</span></li>
				<li>Advanced <span class="No-Break">dashboard techniques</span></li>
				<li>Managing and <span class="No-Break">organizing dashboards</span></li>
				<li>Case study – an overall <span class="No-Break">system view</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you will work with the Grafana user interface using the Grafana Cloud instance and the demo you set up in <a href="B18277_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor063"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a>. Also, to ensure you have all the data sources and settings available, be sure to have implemented the updates in <a href="B18277_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor134"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></span></a> to your stack. Let’s dive in and create our <span class="No-Break">first dashboard.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Creating your first dashboard</h1>
			<p>Dashboards are a medium to communicate<a id="_idIndexMarker690"/> important and sometimes urgent information to consumers. Before we delve into design techniques and best practices, let’s get familiar with the Grafana user interface to start with a simple dashboard. The demo application we have worked with throughout this book has a frontend store; let’s look at the requests we get for its <span class="No-Break">shopping cart.</span></p>
			<p>To create your first panel and dashboard, follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>In your Grafana instance, select <strong class="bold">Explore</strong> in <span class="No-Break">the menu.</span></li>
				<li>Choose your Prometheus data source; this will be labeled as <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">grafanacloud-&lt;team&gt;-prom (default)</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Metric</strong> dropdown, choose <strong class="bold">app_frontend_requests_total</strong> (the metric count of requests to the frontend app), and in the <strong class="bold">Label filters</strong> dropdown, choose <strong class="bold">target = /api/cart</strong> as the filter (to restrict the results to the cart API only), and then click on <strong class="bold">Run query</strong>. You should see data <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p>We now have our first dashboard, but it is very<a id="_idIndexMarker695"/> simple, with only one panel. It does not effectively communicate much, and the number of frontend requests alone does not give an indication of what is happening to our online store. Let’s explore what else we can do to <span class="No-Break">improve this.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Developing your dashboard further</h1>
			<p>Let’s now develop our dashboard<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> further and improve the information we share. Approaching your dashboard as a work in progress that you can iterate over as you develop the message it is communicating is key to getting the right message across. In this section, we’ll use an example where there’s an increasing count of requests to the frontend app, which does not really tell us much. Showing the rate of those requests makes more sense, as we will be able to see the speed at which they arrive in our app. Let’s make that <span class="No-Break">change now:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>From the panel’s triple-dots drop-down menu, select <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> and you will see the <span class="No-Break">following screen:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer126" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.10.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – The panel editor"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.10 – The panel editor</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Back in the panel editor, we can see that the query build gives us a hint to add a rate; this is highlighted with a blue box <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>around it. Click on this hint to add the suggested aggregation to the existing query (if the hint does not appear, click the <strong class="bold">Operations</strong> button, and select <strong class="bold">Rate</strong> with a range <span class="No-Break">of </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">$__rate_interval</strong></span><span class="No-Break">):</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer127" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.11.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – The Rate query"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.11 – The Rate query</p>
			<p class="list-inset">As you can see, the graph now shows how many frontend <strong class="bold">GET</strong> and <strong class="bold">POST</strong> requests per second come into our store. This is much more useful, but the legend is confusing, so let’s clean <span class="No-Break">that up.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Expand the <strong class="bold">Options</strong> section just below the PromQL <span class="No-Break">query preview.</span></li>
				<li>Replace the contents of the <strong class="bold">Legend</strong> field with the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> label identifier (<strong class="source-inline">{{method}}</strong>), as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 8</em></span><em class="italic">.12</em>; this will extract the values from the method label as the values for the <span class="No-Break">graph’s legend.</span></li>
				<li>While we are here, let’s also change<a id="_idIndexMarker698"/> the title to reflect we are now showing a rate, not a count, and add a meaningful description, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer128" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.12.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Panel updates"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.12 – Panel updates</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Once again, click the <strong class="bold">Apply</strong> button to update the panel and return to the dashboard. You should see a dashboard <span class="No-Break">like this:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer129" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.13.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13 – Our first dashboard"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.13 – Our first dashboard</p>
			<p>As we can see in the preceding screenshot, we now have a meaningful presentation of the rate of <strong class="bold">GET</strong> and <strong class="bold">POST</strong> requests coming into the frontend API. The name of the dashboard and panel reflect their purpose well, and there is also a new <strong class="bold">i</strong> icon next to the panel, which will display the description<a id="_idIndexMarker699"/> you added when you hover <span class="No-Break">over it.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s now look at the visualizations available in Grafana and how to <span class="No-Break">use them.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Using visualizations in Grafana</h1>
			<p>Grafana has a large selection<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> of visualizations to support your varying use cases<a id="_idIndexMarker701"/> and data formats. For example, for the counter and gauge metric types, you could use the <strong class="bold">Stat</strong> or <strong class="bold">Gauge</strong> visualization, and the histogram could use <strong class="bold">Bar chart</strong> or <strong class="bold">Gauge</strong>. Logs can be presented using the table visualization or by generating metrics from your logs in the time series chart. You can find<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> the latest searchable list of plugins here on the Grafana website: <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/panel-plugins/">https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/panel-plugins/</a>. A great place to try them out and get ideas you can use in your own dashboards is <a href="https://play.grafana.org">https://play.grafana.org</a>, where you will find dashboard examples<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> of all the panel visualizations along with a wide range of <span class="No-Break">data types.</span></p>
			<p>To change the panel visualization from within the panel editor, you can use the visualization selector, which is on the top right-hand side. Selecting it will display a searchable list, with a graphical representation of what the visualization looks like. This can be seen in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.14.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14 – Grafana visualizations"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.14 – Grafana visualizations</p>
			<p>Let’s try this with<a id="_idIndexMarker704"/> our panel <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>on our <span class="No-Break">first dashboard:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>From the panel’s triple-dots drop-down menu, <span class="No-Break">select </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Edit</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Stat</strong> from the list of panel visualizations. You should see the dashboard panel change to look similar to <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer131" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.15.jpg" alt="Figure 8.15 – Stat visualisation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.15 – Stat visualisation</p>
			<p>To better understand the options available, take some time to try out the different visualizations, or spend time on Grafana<a id="_idIndexMarker706"/> Play exploring the examples there. Once you know the visualizations available<a id="_idIndexMarker707"/> and the different panel configurations for each, it will become much easier for you to design your <span class="No-Break">own dashboards.</span></p>
			<p>A typical panel configuration will have the <span class="No-Break">following items:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">A title and description</strong>: While the title should help people understand the data presented, the description should complement or embellish <span class="No-Break">the title.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A legend configuration</strong>: The legend should help interpret data presented with context and clarity. It can be formatted to support visually processing data and can interact with the view, filtering data to the <span class="No-Break">selected item.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A standard options setup</strong>: This is used to control the options for the units, maximum and minimum values, decimals, display name, and <span class="No-Break">color scheme.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A panel-specific options setup</strong>: Each visualization can have its own <span class="No-Break">panel configurations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Thresholds</strong>: These are used to control colors, backgrounds, or values displayed, based on whether a data threshold value is met <span class="No-Break">or exceeded.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Overrides</strong>: Custom visualization settings can be applied to data to format and alter the presentation – for example, removing decimals and showing <span class="No-Break">unit identifiers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Value mappings</strong>: These are similar to the overrides used to change the visual treatment of your data. They can be used to replace returned values with colors or values based on data matches (including ranges and regular expressions) to alter the <span class="No-Break">visual presentation.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Spending time developing your familiarity with the configuration of some of the main visualization panels will give you the confidence<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> to shape and present data<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> for <span class="No-Break">your users.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s now take a look at some design concepts that will help you present your data <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Developing a dashboard purpose</h1>
			<p>When creating a dashboard, it is very important that it has an objective. There are three key questions you can ask yourself to help you get the answers that identify<a id="_idIndexMarker710"/> <span class="No-Break">those objectives:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who is <span class="No-Break">the audience?</span></li>
				<li>What are <span class="No-Break">their requirements?</span></li>
				<li>Where will the dashboard be viewed (on a big screen or a <span class="No-Break">mobile phone)?</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>A dashboard must tell a story or answer a question, but we cannot do either of those things without answering the preceding questions. Let’s refer to the personas introduced in <a href="B18277_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a> to think about the type of people who need<a id="_idIndexMarker711"/> dashboards, what they want from them, and where they will <span class="No-Break">see them:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 8.1 – Dashboard users and needs</p>
			<p>Capturing end user requirements <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>and delivering them with the dashboards you create will ensure value is taken from your observability platform and increase adoption. Once you have your user requirements and have analyzed your data (so that you understand what important information is there), you can start pulling your dashboards together. We say pulling together because it’s important to remember you are creating something to answer a question, and that’s going to take time. Do not be afraid to try out different styles, layouts, and visualizations as you work on the goal for each dashboard. Be sure to test under the different presentation requirements; if it’s a large wall screen display or an emailed PDF, you want to ensure you have verified that it <span class="No-Break">displays correctly.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at some techniques that will help <span class="No-Break">with presentation.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Advanced dashboard techniques</h1>
			<p>To communicate effectively<a id="_idIndexMarker713"/> with our dashboards, we can use a layout and some technical features to up our game. Let’s start looking at some of these <span class="No-Break">in detail:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Layout tricks</strong>: To help get your message across, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker714"/> to consider a few layout tricks that really make your message pop. These include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span><ul><li>Use a short top title in the <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> panel to make it clearer <span class="No-Break">to read.</span></li><li>Add a description showing how to use the information and who it’s for to give the users the best chance of understanding the <span class="No-Break">data presented.</span></li><li>Call out key indicators using visualizations such as <strong class="bold">Stat</strong> with sparklines, and show them first at the top of <span class="No-Break">your dashboard.</span></li><li>Present panels in a grid to visually guide viewers through your dashboard and control <span class="No-Break">their focus.</span></li><li>Do not cram too many panels into a single dashboard; this makes it hard to digest. Instead, use datalinks to other dashboards and separate the <span class="No-Break">data more.</span></li><li>Use transparent panels to introduce visual spacing on your dashboard and help key data <span class="No-Break">stand out.</span></li><li>Use rows to group relevant panels and data together, creating a context for <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li><li>Use the collapse feature of rows to hide certain data when the dashboard loads; this will also have the performance benefit of not running those queries until the row <span class="No-Break">is expanded.</span></li><li>Group similar visualizations to make the dashboard easier to read; this makes it easier to process<a id="_idIndexMarker715"/> the <span class="No-Break">data presented.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tech tips</strong>: Grafana comes with some really<a id="_idIndexMarker716"/> useful features; here are a few tips to help you work smarter and speed up your <span class="No-Break">development cycle:</span><ul><li>Save dashboards often, or back them up by exporting <span class="No-Break">the JSON.</span></li><li>Use useful change messages to help your future self when <span class="No-Break">reviewing changes.</span></li><li>Remember that dashboard versions are saved, and these can be compared for changes if you need to debug a problem that has crept into <span class="No-Break">your dashboard.</span></li><li>Create interactive and dynamic dashboards to engage viewers and deliver a message <span class="No-Break">more effectively.</span></li><li>Use dashboard variables to get more use from your dashboard and help the viewer see data they are interested in; these are displayed as inputs at the top of <span class="No-Break">the dashboard.</span></li><li>Avoid hardcoding values in panels and queries; your future self will appreciate this as the number of systems being monitored grows and new data is added that changes <span class="No-Break">your dashboards.</span></li><li>Use relative time ranges as defaults to ensure the initial view is standardized – for example, set the from time to <strong class="source-inline">now-15m</strong> to show the last <span class="No-Break">15 minutes.</span></li><li>Use transformations to present your data in more digestible formats. The <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> tab and available transforms are shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></li></ul></li>

			<p>Let’s now look at how we can develop good practices to maintain control over <span class="No-Break">our dashboards.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Managing and organizing dashboards</h1>
			<p>As the list of dashboards and teams<a id="_idIndexMarker718"/> using them grows, you will need a way to manage<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> them easier. Grafana provides folders, tags, and permissions that give us the capability to get organized. From the main <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong> screen, you can create folders, move and delete dashboards, and star them, as you can see in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.18 – The Dashboards screen</p>
			<p>From the dashboard <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> screen, you can add<a id="_idIndexMarker720"/> or remove tags from individual<a id="_idIndexMarker721"/> dashboards, as shown in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer140" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.19.jpg" alt="Figure 8.19 – Dashboard settings"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.19 – Dashboard settings</p>
			<p>Let’s look at the available settings for folders, tags, <span class="No-Break">and permissions:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Folders</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Provide easy organization<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> <span class="No-Break">and grouping</span></li><li>Enhanced security by segregating permissions at the <span class="No-Break">folder level</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Tags</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Useful when searching<a id="_idIndexMarker723"/> for <span class="No-Break">related dashboards</span></li><li>Color-coded for <span class="No-Break">visual recognition</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Permissions</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>Control access<a id="_idIndexMarker724"/> to folders and <span class="No-Break">their dashboards</span></li><li>Give viewer access only to those who do not need <span class="No-Break">to edit</span></li><li>Hide folders on a <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">need-to-know</em></span><span class="No-Break"> basis</span></li><li>Available for both individual users <span class="No-Break">and teams</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you have an understanding<a id="_idIndexMarker725"/> of the concepts involved, let’s look at a case<a id="_idIndexMarker726"/> study to develop a dashboard for one of <span class="No-Break">our personas.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Case study – an overall system view</h1>
			<p>We will now walk through the process<a id="_idIndexMarker727"/> you would take to develop dashboards for <em class="italic">Steven</em> the Service Manager. If you recall from <a href="B18277_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></span></a>, he works in service delivery. He wants the organization’s services to run as smoothly <span class="No-Break">as possible.</span></p>
			<p>We will start with a use case; in an earlier section in this chapter, <em class="italic">Developing a dashboard purpose</em>, we recorded the following requirement <span class="No-Break">from Steven:</span></p>
			<p class="author-quote">“Overall, a system view that helps me see the wider picture. If there is a problem, I need the information to identify who can solve it. I will view this on my computer.”</p>
			<p>This can be broken down into <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A top-level <span class="No-Break">system view</span></li>
				<li>Problem indicators (to <span class="No-Break">highlight issues)</span></li>
				<li>More detail <span class="No-Break">when needed</span></li>
				<li>Assistance in identifying who <span class="No-Break">can help</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We then need to gather information<a id="_idIndexMarker728"/> from documentation and by <span class="No-Break">having conversations.</span></p>
			<p>We have been using the OpenTelemetry<a id="_idIndexMarker729"/> demo app throughout the book; fortunately, architecture diagrams are provided at https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/architecture/, which will help us understand the <span class="No-Break">system better.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s look at the OpenTelemetry demo system <span class="No-Break">architecture diagram:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer141" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.20.jpg" alt="Figure 8.20 – OpenTelemetry demo system architecture"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.20 – OpenTelemetry demo system architecture</p>
			<p>We will also look at what telemetry is being ingested for these applications. This could be done by exploring Grafana ourselves; we have system names now and application flows. Alternatively, we could talk to <em class="italic">Diego</em> the Developer and obtain his insight into <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>If you are exploring by yourself, this is<a id="_idIndexMarker730"/> a good time to build a research dashboard. This is where you add panels as you explore and discover interesting data. We did this with our first dashboard earlier in this chapter, starting with frontend requests and then enhancing it to show the rate of frontend requests. Otherwise, start building up a scrapbook dashboard of data you may want to use; do not worry about layout or visualizations <span class="No-Break">right now.</span></p>
			<p>To help us choose useful<a id="_idIndexMarker731"/> metrics, we can use a methodology such as the <strong class="bold">Four Golden Signals</strong>, as identified in Google’s <em class="italic">Site Reliability Engineering</em> handbook (https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals). There are other popular methods available – for example, the <strong class="bold">Utilization, Saturation, Errors</strong> (<strong class="bold">USE</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Rate, Errors, Duration</strong> (<strong class="bold">RED</strong>) methods, which we will discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker732"/> in the <span class="No-Break">next</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker733"/></span><span class="No-Break"> chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s quickly take a look at the Four <span class="No-Break">Golden Signals:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Latency</strong>: The time taken to service <span class="No-Break">a request</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Traffic</strong>: How much demand is placed on <span class="No-Break">your system</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Errors</strong>: The rate of requests <span class="No-Break">that fail</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Saturation</strong>: How full your system <span class="No-Break">services are</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you have some key metric data ready for use, you can start shaping your dashboard. Remember that a dashboard should tell a story or answer a question; <em class="italic">Steven</em> has said he wants a top-level system view that highlights problems with access to more detailed information as and when needed. We can follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let’s start with the first row of the dashboard, creating the first-look area. By choosing metrics detailing the flow of traffic through our system, we can use visualizations such as <strong class="bold">Stats</strong> (with a timeline) to stand out. Lead the viewer, <em class="italic">Steven,</em> from left to right, with the most important<a id="_idIndexMarker734"/> <span class="No-Break">information first.</span><p class="list-inset">Here’s an example of <strong class="bold">Stats</strong> with timeline visualizations for the <span class="No-Break">first-look area:</span></p></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer142" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.21.jpg" alt="Figure 8.21 – A system overview"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.21 – A system overview</p>
			<p class="list-inset">Other visualizations such as <strong class="bold">Gauge</strong> are good to represent the saturation of <span class="No-Break">a system.</span></p>
			<p class="list-inset">To ensure Steven’s attention is drawn to the most important information first, we can enhance our panels with thresholds, overrides, and value mappings. In certain panels, we can even overlay further context <span class="No-Break">as annotations.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">We then need to find a way to communicate more detailed information and decide this based on how much information we have to display. We have to ask <span class="No-Break">two questions:</span><ul><li>Can we present the detailed information here on this dashboard itself (is there <span class="No-Break">enough room)?</span></li><li>Do we need to drill down into other, more <span class="No-Break">focused dashboards?</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">For our use case, we will work on the <em class="italic">same</em> dashboard. To support <em class="italic">Steven</em> with the identification of who he needs to support in the event of an incident, we can do <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p><ul><li>We can logically group our visualizations in rows. Each row can be a team, and the first panel can be a text panel used to share contact information and provide details on how to engage the team. This means the cognitive load when using the dashboard is greatly reduced, helping <em class="italic">Steven</em> solve problems <span class="No-Break">more quickly.</span></li><li>We can also use panel descriptions to share useful information that helps viewers, including <em class="italic">Steven</em>, understand the data, and dashboard links to callout support pages will <span class="No-Break">also help.</span></li><li>To represent more detailed information better, we could use visualizations such as the table panel along with color coding to provide visual aids, helping to process the <span class="No-Break">information quicker.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here, we have an example<a id="_idIndexMarker735"/> with top-level insights and more detailed and directional (i.e., identifying the owning or supporting teams) panels <span class="No-Break">and rows:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B18277_8.22.jpg" alt="Figure 8.22 – A detailed dashboard"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.22 – A detailed dashboard</p>
			<p>As you can see from this fictional example, building a useful dashboard requires several iterations. Much more than telemetry alone goes into the process, but the results mean <em class="italic">Steven</em> can do his job and have the best shot at delivering <span class="No-Break">customer satisfaction.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s now close this chapter with a few words<a id="_idIndexMarker736"/> on how you can support your development <span class="No-Break">with dashboards.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we explored the different components of a dashboard and looked at the different details we need to factor in. These techniques will take time to build, so approach your dashboard development in the same way, get something simple built early, and iterate on it. We talked about the visualizations available for panels and inspiration on websites such as <a href="http://play.grafana.org">play.grafana.org</a>. Have some fun, and try out alternative methods to present your data and find a style you like. Finally, we looked at some tricks and tips to improve your dashboarding, wrapping up with some simple ideas to help you manage <span class="No-Break">your dashboards.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about <strong class="bold">incident management</strong> and the great tools available from Grafana that <span class="No-Break">support it.</span></p>
