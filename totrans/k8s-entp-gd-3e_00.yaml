- en: Kubernetes has taken the world by storm, becoming the standard infrastructure
    for DevOps teams to develop, test, and run applications. Most enterprises are
    either running it already or are planning to run it in the next year. A look at
    job postings on any of the major job sites shows that just about every big-name
    company has Kubernetes positions open. The fast rate of adoption has led to Kubernetes-related
    positions growing by over 2,000% in the last 4 years.

  zh: Kubernetes已经风靡全球，成为DevOps团队开发、测试和运行应用程序的标准基础设施。大多数企业要么已经在使用它，要么计划在明年内使用它。从任何一个主要招聘网站上的职位发布可以看出，几乎每个大公司都有Kubernetes相关的职位空缺。Kubernetes的快速普及导致与Kubernetes相关的职位在过去四年中增长了超过2000%。
- en: One common problem that companies are struggling to address is the lack of enterprise
    Kubernetes knowledge. While Kubernetes isn’t new anymore (it just turned 10!),
    companies have had issues with trying to build teams to run clusters reliably.
    They’ve also struggled to understand how to integrate Kubernetes workloads across
    the multiple silos and technology stacks that are common in the enterprise world.
    Finding people with basic Kubernetes skills is becoming easier, but finding people
    with knowledge on topics that are required for enterprise clusters is still a
    challenge.

  zh: 公司普遍面临的一个常见问题是缺乏企业级的Kubernetes知识。虽然Kubernetes已经不再是新技术（它刚刚迎来10周年！），但企业在构建能够可靠运行集群的团队方面仍然存在困难。它们还面临如何跨多个孤岛和技术栈整合Kubernetes工作负载的问题，这些问题在企业环境中很常见。虽然找到具备基础Kubernetes技能的人变得更加容易，但要找到具备企业集群所需的专业知识的人仍然是一个挑战。

    clusters, creating Deployments, and using Kubernetes objects. Our plan was to
    create a book that would go beyond a basic cluster, and to keep the book at a
    reasonable length, we have not re-hashed the basics of Kubernetes. Readers should
    have some experience with Kubernetes and DevOps before reading this book.

    features, the first section of the book will provide a refresher on key Docker
    topics and Kubernetes objects. It is important that you have a solid understanding

    clusters using KinD, a powerful tool that allows you to create clusters ranging
    from a single-node cluster to a full multi-node cluster. The chapter goes beyond
    a basic **KinD** cluster, explaining how to use a load balancer running **HAProxy**
    to load-balance worker nodes. By the end of the chapter, you will understand how
    KinD works and how to create a custom multi-node cluster, which will be used for
    the exercises in the chapters.'

    chapter will cover most of the objects that a cluster includes , which will be
    helpful if you are new to Kubernetes. It will explain each object with a description
    of what each object does and its function in a cluster. It is meant to be a refresher,
    or a “pocket guide” to objects. It does not contain exhaustive details for each
    object (that would require a second book).'

    with examples, and you will learn how to expose them using both a layer 7 and
    layer 4 load balancer. In this chapter, you will go beyond the basics of a simple
    Ingress controller, installing **MetalLB**, to provide layer 4 access to services.

    authorizes access via its **role-based access control** (**RBAC**) system. In
