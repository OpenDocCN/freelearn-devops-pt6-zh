- en: Running business applications in the form of microservices that are packaged
    in containers is the norm today. As per a survey done by Cloud Native Computing
    Foundation in 2021 ([https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021/](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021/)),
    around 80% of applications are deployed on Kubernetes. However, building containerized
    applications and production-grade Kubernetes platforms are some hard nuts to crack.
    Moreover, enterprises consider a multi-cloud deployment strategy that adds more
    operational complexities for different reasons. In this book, we will learn how
    different tools in the VMware Tanzu portfolio come together to solve the challenges
    of building, running, and managing modern applications on multi-cloud Kubernetes
    platforms.

- en: We have divided this book into three logical parts in line with the application
    development life cycle. In the first part, we will review different tools that
    help build secure applications. In this part, we will also see how to containerize
    these applications and manage the APIs exposed by them. In the second part, we
    will dive deeper into the tools that help run these apps at scale. We will cover
    tools that will help manage container images and deploy Kubernetes platforms in
    multi-cloud setups. This section also covers deploying secure paths to production
    with supply chain choreography. In the last part of the book, we will see how
    to manage large Kubernetes deployments. This section covers a single pane of glass
    for monitoring, securing, and governing multi-cloud deployments.

    and the respective Tanzu tool(s) related to that aspect. These chapters describe
    the business case and its applicable challenges first – the *why* behind the tool(s).
    Then, they provide the required details for the applicable tool(s) at a high level
    – the *what* behind the tool(s). Finally, they cover the details on how to get
    started with them – the *how* behind the tool(s).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone who wants to know what VMware Tanzu is. The reader will
    learn about different security, operational, and developer productivity challenges
    that are addressed by this platform. The purpose of this book is to acquire a
    good level of understanding about this technology from a learning point of view.
    It is also aimed to help the reader to perform primary day-1 and day-2 operations
    on different tools for a hands-on experience. If you are **a cloud or application
    architect**, this book will help you understand the various capabilities these
    tools offer to decide how to or whether to include them in your solutions. If
    you are either a **developer** or a **development lead**, you will learn about
    different ways to improve developer productivity. If you are a **security officer**,
    you will find better ways to secure your cloud-native applications and Kubernetes
    platforms. Lastly, if you are a **DevOps engineer** or a **cloud platform operator**,
    you will learn how to work with these products for various operations around them.

    in the area of building and running modern applications. However, some experience
    with Kubernetes will help to relate the concepts and challenges better. Additionally,
    the reader should have some experience working with **command-line interfaces**
    (**CLIs**) to follow all the hands-on instructions.
