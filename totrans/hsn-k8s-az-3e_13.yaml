- en: Up to this point, you've been using a form of access to **Azure Kubernetes Service**
    (**AKS**) that gave you permissions to create, read, update, and delete all objects
    in your cluster. This has worked great for testing and development but is not
    recommended on production clusters. On production clusters, the recommendation
    is to leverage **role-based access control** (**RBAC**) in Kubernetes to only
    grant a limited set of permissions to users.
  prefs: []

- en: In this chapter, you will explore Kubernetes RBAC in more depth. You will be
    introduced to the concept of RBAC in Kubernetes. You will then configure RBAC
    in Kubernetes and integrate it with **Azure Active Directory** (**Azure AD**).

- en: In production systems, you need to allow different users different levels of
    access to certain resources; this is known as **RBAC**. The benefit of establishing
    RBAC is that it not only acts as a guardrail against the accidental deletion of
    critical resources but also is an important security feature that limits full
    access to the cluster to roles that really need it. On an RBAC-enabled cluster,
    users can only access and modify those resources for which they have permission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up until now, using Cloud Shell, you have been acting as *root*, which allowed
    you to do anything and everything in the cluster. For production use cases, root
    access is dangerous and should be restricted as much as possible. It is a generally
    accepted best practice to use the **principle of least privilege** (**PoLP**)
    to sign in to any computer system. This prevents both access to secure data and
    unintentional downtime through the deletion of key resources. Anywhere between
    22% and 29% of data loss is attributed to human error. You don't want to be a
    part of that statistic.

    as creating, modifying, and deleting clusters. Kubernetes RBAC deals with the

- en: In this chapter, you learned about RBAC on AKS. You enabled Azure AD–integrated
    RBAC in your cluster. After that, you created a new user and group and set up
    different RBAC roles on your cluster. Finally, you signed in using that user and
    were able to verify that the RBAC roles that were configured gave you limited
    access to the cluster you were expecting.

- en: This deals with how users can get access to your Kubernetes cluster. The pods
    running on your cluster might also need an identity in Azure AD that they can
    use to access resources in Azure services such as Blob Storage or Key Vault. You
    will learn more about this use case and how to set this up using an Azure AD pod
    identity in AKS in the next chapter.
